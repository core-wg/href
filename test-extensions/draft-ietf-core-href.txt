Abstract

   The Constrained Resource Identifier (CRI) is a complement to the
   Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that represents the URI components
   in Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) rather than as a
   sequence of characters.  This approach simplifies parsing,
   comparison, and reference resolution in environments with severe
   limitations on processing power, code size, and memory size.

   This RFC updates RFC 7595 to add a note on how the "URI Schemes"
   registry of RFC 7595 cooperates with the "CRI Scheme Numbers"
   registry created by the present RFC.


   // (This "cref" paragraph will be removed by the RFC editor:) The
   // present revision –19 addresses WGLC comments.

1.  Introduction

   The Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) [STD66] and its most common
   usage, the URI reference, are the Internet standard for linking to
   resources in hypertext formats such as HTML [W3C.REC-html52-20171214]
   or the HTTP "Link" header field [RFC8288].

   A URI reference is a sequence of characters chosen from the
   repertoire of US-ASCII characters (Section 4.1 of RFC 3986 [STD66]).
   The individual components of a URI reference are delimited by a
   number of reserved characters, which necessitates the use of a

Internet-Draft      Constrained Resource Identifiers          March 2025


   character escape mechanism called "percent-encoding" when these
   reserved characters are used in a non-delimiting function.  The
   resolution of URI references (Section 5 of RFC 3986 [STD66]) involves
   parsing a character sequence into its components, combining those
   components with the components of a base URI, merging path
   components, removing dot-segments ("." and "..", see Section 3.3 of
   RFC 3986 [STD66]), and recomposing the result back into a character
   sequence.

   Overall, the proper handling of URI references is quite intricate.
   This can be a problem especially in constrained environments
   [RFC7228][I-D.ietf-iotops-7228bis], where nodes often have severe
   code size and memory size limitations.  As a result, many
   implementations in such environments support only an ad-hoc,
   informally-specified, bug-ridden, non-interoperable subset of half of
   [STD66] (aperçu adapted from [GREENSPUN-10]).

   This document defines the _Constrained Resource Identifier (CRI)_ by
   constraining URIs to a simplified subset and representing their
   components in Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) [STD94]
   instead of a sequence of characters.  Analogously, _CRI references_
   are to CRIs what URI references are to URIs.

   CRIs and CRI references allow typical operations on URIs and URI
   references such as parsing, comparison, and reference resolution
   (including all corner cases) to be implemented in a comparatively
   small amount of code and to be less prone to bugs and
   interoperability issues.

   As a result of simplification, however, CRIs are not capable of
   expressing all URIs permitted by the generic syntax of [STD66] (hence
   the "constrained" in "Constrained Resource Identifier").  The
   supported subset includes all URIs of the Constrained Application
   Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252], most URIs of the Hypertext Transfer
   Protocol (HTTP) [STD97], Uniform Resource Names (URNs) [RFC8141], and
   other similar URIs.  The exact constraints are defined in Section 2.
   CRI extensions (Section 7) can be defined to address some of the
   constraints.

   This RFC creates a "CRI Scheme Numbers" registry and updates RFC7595
   to add a note on how this new registry cooperates with the "URI
   Schemes" registry that RFC7595 describes.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [BCP14] (RFC2119) (RFC8174) when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   In this specification, the term "byte" is used in its now customary
   sense as a synonym for "octet".

   Terms defined in this document appear in _cursive_ where they are
   introduced (in the plaintext form of this document, they are rendered
   as the new term surrounded by underscores).

   The general structure of data items is shown in the Concise Data
   Definition Language (CDDL) [RFC8610] including its control extensions
   [RFC9165].  Specific examples are notated in CBOR Extended Diagnostic
   Notation (EDN), as originally introduced in Section 8 of RFC 8949
   [STD94] and extended in Appendix G of [RFC8610].
   ([I-D.ietf-cbor-edn-literals] more rigorously defines and further
   extends EDN.)

2.  From URIs to CRIs: Considerations and Constraints

2.1.  The CRI interchange data model

   A Constrained Resource Identifier consists of the same five
   components as a URI: scheme, authority, path, query, and fragment.
   The components are subject to the considerations and constraints
   listed in this section.  Note that CRI extensions can relax
   constraints; for example, see Section 7.1 for partially relaxing
   constraint C0.

   C0.   Text strings in CRIs ("CRI text strings") are CBOR text strings
         (i.e., in UTF-8 form [STD63]) that represent Unicode strings
         (see Definition D80 in [Unicode]) in Unicode Normalization Form
         C (NFC) (see Definition D120 in [Unicode] and specifically
         Section 3, Paragraph 7).

   C1.   The scheme name can be any CRI text string that matches the
         syntax of a URI scheme (see Section 3.1 of RFC 3986 [STD66],
         which constrains scheme names to a subset of ASCII), in its
         canonical form.  (The canonical form as per Section 3.1 of RFC
         3986 [STD66] requires alphabetic characters to be in
         lowercase.)  The scheme is always present.

Internet-Draft      Constrained Resource Identifiers          March 2025


   C2.   An authority is always a host identified by an IP address or
         registered name, along with optional port information, and
         optionally preceded by user information.

         Alternatively, the authority can be absent; the two cases for
         this defined in Section 3.3 of RFC 3986 [STD66] are modeled by
         two different values used in place of an absent authority:

         *  the path can be root-based (zero or more path segments that
            are each started in the URI with "/", as when the authority
            is present), or

         *  the path can be rootless, which requires at least one path
            segment, the first one of which has non-zero length.

         (Note that, in Figure 2, no-authority is marked as a feature,
         as not all CRI implementations will support authority-less
         URIs.)

   C3.   A userinfo is a text string built out of unreserved characters
         (Section 2.3 of RFC 3986 [STD66]) or "sub-delims" (Section 2.2
         of RFC 3986 [STD66]); any other character needs to be percent-
         encoded (Section 7.1).  Note that this excludes the ":"
         character, which is commonly deprecated as a way to delimit a
         cleartext password in a userinfo.

   C4.   An IP address can be either an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address
         (optionally with a zone identifier [RFC6874]; see Section 6.1,
         Paragraph 2.4.7).  Future versions of IP are not supported (it
         is likely that a binary mapping would be strongly desirable,
         and that cannot be designed ahead of time, so these versions
         need to be added as a future extension if needed).

   C5.   A registered name is a sequence of one or more _labels_, which,
         when joined with dots (".") in between them, result in a
         lowercase CRI text string.  (The syntax may be further
         restricted by the scheme.  As per Section 3.2.2 of RFC 3986
         [STD66], a registered name can be empty, for which case a
         scheme can define a default for the host.)

   C6.   A port is always an integer in the range from 0 to 65535.
         Ports outside this range, empty ports (port subcomponents with
         no digits, see Section 3.2.3 of RFC 3986 [STD66]), or ports
         with redundant leading zeros, are not supported.

Internet-Draft      Constrained Resource Identifiers          March 2025


   C7.   If the scheme's port handling is known to the CRI creator, it
         is RECOMMENDED to omit the port if and only if the port would
         be the same as the scheme's default port (provided the scheme
         is defining such a default port) or the scheme is not using
         ports.

   C8.   A path consists of zero or more path segments.  Note that a
         path of just a single zero-length path segment is allowed —
         this is considered equivalent to a path of zero path segments
         by HTTP and CoAP, but this equivalence does not hold for CRIs
         in general as they only perform normalization on the Syntax-
         Based Normalization level (Section 6.2.2 of RFC 3986 [STD66]),
         not on the scheme-specific Scheme-Based Normalization level
         (Section 6.2.3 of RFC 3986 [STD66]).

         (A CRI implementation may want to offer scheme-cognizant
         interfaces, performing this scheme-specific normalization for
         schemes it knows.  The interface could assert which schemes the
         implementation knows and provide pre-normalized CRIs.  This can
         also relieve the application from removing a lone zero-length
         path segment before putting path segments into CoAP Options,
         i.e., from performing the check and jump in item 8 of
         Section 6.4 of [RFC7252].  See also SP1 in Appendix B.)

   C9.   A path segment can be any CRI text string, with the exception
         of the special "." and ".." complete path segments.  Note that
         this includes the zero-length string.

         If no authority is present in a CRI, the leading path segment
         cannot be empty.  (See also SP1 in Appendix B.)

   C10.  A query always consists of one or more query parameters.  A
         query parameter can be any CRI text string.  It is often in the
         form of a "key=value" pair.  When converting a CRI to a URI,
         query parameters are separated by an ampersand ("&") character.
         (This matches the structure and encoding of the target URI in
         CoAP requests.)  Queries are optional; there is a difference
         between an absent query and a single query parameter that is
         the empty string.

   C11.  A fragment identifier can be any CRI text string.  Fragment
         identifiers are optional; there is a difference between an
         absent fragment identifier and a fragment identifier that is
         the empty string.

Internet-Draft      Constrained Resource Identifiers          March 2025


   C12.  The syntax of registered names, path segments, query
         parameters, and fragment identifiers may be further restricted
         and sub-structured by the scheme.  There is no support,
         however, for escaping sub-delimiters that are not intended to
         be used in a delimiting function.

   C13.  When converting a CRI to a URI, any character that is outside
         the allowed character range or is a delimiter in the URI syntax
         is percent-encoded.  For CRIs, percent-encoding always uses the
         UTF-8 encoding form (see Definition D92 in [Unicode]) to
         convert the character to a sequence of bytes, which are then
         converted to a sequence of %HH triplets.

   Examples for URIs at or beyond the boundaries of these constraints
   are in SP2 in Appendix B.

2.2.  CRI References: The discard Component

   As with URI references and URIs, CRI references are a shorthand for a
   CRI that is expressed relative to a base CRI.  URI and CRI references
   often _discard_ part or all of the trailing path segments of the base
   URI or CRI.

   In a URI reference, this is expressed by syntax for its path
   component such as leading special path segments . and .. or a leading
   slash before giving the path segments to be added at the end of the
   (now truncated) base URI.  For use in CRI references, we instead add
   in a discard component as an alternative to the scheme and authority
   components, making the specification of discarding base URI path
   segments separate from adding new path segments from the CRI
   reference.

   The discarding intent of a CRI reference is thus fully condensed to a
   single value in its discard component:

   *  An unsigned integer as the discard component specifies the number
      of path segments to be discarded from the base CRI (note that this
      includes the value 0 which cannot be expressed in URI references
      that then add any path component);

   *  the value true as the discard component specifies discarding all
      path segments from the base CRI.

   If a scheme or authority is present in a CRI reference, the discard
   component is implicitly equivalent to a value of true and thus not
   included in the interchanged data item.

Internet-Draft      Constrained Resource Identifiers          March 2025


2.3.  Constraints not expressed by the data model

   There are syntactically valid CRIs and CRI references that cannot be
   converted into a URI or URI reference, respectively.

   CRI references of this kind can be acceptable -- they still can be
   resolved and result in a valid full CRI that can be converted back.
   Examples of this are:

   *  [0, ["p"]]: appends a slash and the path segment "p" to its base
      (and unsets the query and the fragment)

   *  [0, null, []]: leaves the path alone but unsets the query and the
      fragment

   (Full) CRIs that do not correspond to a valid URI are not valid on
   their own, and cannot be used.  Normatively they are characterized by
   the Section 6.1 process not producing a valid and syntax-normalized
   URI.  For easier understanding, they are listed here:

   *  CRIs (and CRI references) containing dot-segments (path segment
      "." or "..").

      These segments would be removed by the remove_dot_segments
      algorithm of [STD66], and thus never produce a normalized URI
      after resolution.

      (In CRI references, the discard value is used to afford segment
      removal (see Section 2.2), and with "." being an unreserved
      character, expressing them as "%2e" and "%2e%2e" is not even
      viable, let alone practical).

   *  CRIs without authority whose path starts with a leading empty
      segment followed by at least one more segment.

      When converted to URIs, these would violate the requirement that
      in absence of an authority, a URI's path cannot begin with two
      slash characters.  (E.g., two leading empty segments would be
      indistinguishable from a URI with a shorter path and a present but
      empty authority component.)  (Compare C9.)

   *  CRIs without authority that are rootless and have an empty path
      component (e.g., ["a", true, []]), which would be

3.  Creation and Normalization

   In general, resource identifiers are generated when a resource is
   initially created or exposed under a certain resource identifier.

   The naming authority that creates a Constrained Resource Identifier
   SHOULD be the authority that governs the namespace of the resource
   identifier (see also [BCP190]).  For example, for the resources of an
   HTTP origin server, that server is responsible for creating the CRIs
   for those resources.  If the naming authority creates a URI instead
   that can be obtained as a conversion result from a CRI (Section 6.1)
   that CRI can be considered to have been created by the naming
   authority.

   The naming authority MUST ensure that any CRI created satisfies the
   required constraints defined in Section 2.  The creation of a CRI
   fails if the CRI cannot be validated to satisfy all of the required
   constraints.

   If a naming authority creates a CRI from user input, it may need to
   apply the following (and only the following) normalizations to get
   the CRI more likely to validate:

   *  map the scheme name to lowercase (C1);

   *  map the registered name to NFC (C5) and split it on embedded dots;

   *  elide the port if it is the default port for the scheme (C7);

   *  map path segments, query parameters, and the fragment identifier
      to NFC form (C9, C10, C11).

   Once a CRI has been created, it can be used and transferred without
   further normalization.  All operations that operate on a CRI SHOULD
   rely on the assumption that the CRI is appropriately pre-normalized.
   (This does not contradict the requirement that, when CRIs are
   transferred, recipients must operate on as-good-as untrusted input
   and fail gracefully in the face of malicious inputs.)

   Note that the processing of CRIs does not imply that all the
   constraints continuously need to be checked and enforced.
   Specifically, the text normalization constraints (NFC) can be
   expanded as: The recipient of a CRI MAY reasonably expect the text
   strings to be in NFC form, but as with any input MUST NOT fail
   (beyond possibly not being able to process the specific CRI) if they
   are not.  So the onus of fulfilling the expectation is on the
   original creator of the CRI, not on each processor (including
   consumer).  This consideration extends to the sources the CRI creator



Bormann & Birkholz      Expires 12 September 2025              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft      Constrained Resource Identifiers          March 2025


   uses in building the text strings, which the CRI creator MAY in turn
   expect to be in NFC form if that expectation is reasonable.  See
   Appendix C of [MNU] for some background.

   CRIs have been designed with the objective that, after the above
   normalization, conversion of two distinct CRIs to URIs do not yield
   the "same" URI, including equivalence under syntax-based
   normalization (Section 6.2.2 of RFC 3986 [STD66]), but not including
   protocol-based normalization.  Note that this objective exclusively
   applies to (full) CRIs, not to CRI references: these need to be
   resolved relative to a base URI, with results that may be equivalent
   or not depending on the base.

4.  Comparison

   One of the most common operations on CRIs is comparison: determining
   whether two CRIs are equivalent, without dereferencing the CRIs
   (i.e., using them to access their respective resource(s)).

   Determination of equivalence or difference of CRIs is based on simple
   component-wise comparison.  If two CRIs are identical component-by-
   component (using code-point-by-code-point comparison for components
   that are Unicode strings) then it is safe to conclude that they are
   equivalent.

   This comparison mechanism is designed to minimize false negatives
   while strictly avoiding false positives.  The constraints defined in
   Section 2 imply the most common forms of syntax- and scheme-based
   normalizations in URIs, but do not comprise protocol-based
   normalizations that require accessing the resources or detailed
   knowledge of the scheme's dereference algorithm.  False negatives can
   be caused, for example, by CRIs that are not appropriately pre-
   normalized and by resource aliases.

   When CRIs are compared to select (or avoid) a network action, such as
   retrieval of a representation, fragment components (if any) do not
   play a role and typically are excluded from the comparison.

5.  CRI References

   The most common usage of a Constrained Resource Identifier is to
   embed it in resource representations, e.g., to express a hyperlink
   between the represented resource and the resource identified by the
   CRI.

   Section 5.1 first defines the representation of CRIs in Concise
   Binary Object Representation (CBOR) [STD94].  When reduced
   representation size is desired, CRIs are often not represented



Bormann & Birkholz      Expires 12 September 2025              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft      Constrained Resource Identifiers          March 2025


   directly.  Instead, CRIs are indirectly referenced through _CRI
   references_. These take advantage of hierarchical locality and
   provide a very compact encoding.  The CBOR representation of CRI
   references also is specified in Section 5.1.

   The only operation defined on a CRI reference is _reference
   resolution_: the act of transforming a CRI reference into a CRI.  An
   application MUST implement this operation by applying the algorithm
   specified in Section 5.3 (or any algorithm that is functionally
   equivalent to it).

   The reverse operation of transforming a CRI into a CRI reference is
   not specified in detail in this document; implementations are free to
   use any algorithm as long as reference resolution of the resulting
   CRI reference yields the original CRI.  Notably, a CRI reference is
   not required to satisfy all of the constraints of a CRI; the only
   requirement on a CRI reference is that reference resolution MUST
   yield the original CRI.

   When testing for equivalence or difference, it is rarely appropriate
   for applications to directly compare CRI references; instead, the
   references are typically resolved to their respective CRI before
   comparison.

5.1.  CBOR Representation


   // RFC Ed.: throughout this section, please replace RFC-XXXX with the
   // RFC number of this specification and remove this note.

   A CRI or CRI reference is encoded as a CBOR array (Major type 4 in
   Section 3.1 of RFC 8949 [STD94]).  Figure 1 has a coarse
   visualization of the structure of this array, without going into the
   details of the elements.

                 Figure 2: CDDL for CRI CBOR representation

   We call the elements of the top-level array _sections_. The sections
   containing the rules scheme, authority, path, query, fragment
   correspond to the components of a URI and thus of a CRI, as described
   in Section 2.  For use in CRI references, the discard section (see
   also Section 2.2) provides an alternative to the scheme and authority
   sections.

   This CDDL specification is simplified for exposition and needs to be
   augmented by the following rules for interchange of CRIs and CRI
   references:

   *  Trailing default values (Table 1) MUST be removed.

   *  Two leading null values (scheme and authority both not given) MUST
      be represented by using the discard alternative instead.

   *  An empty path in a CRI MUST be represented as the empty array [].
      Note that for CRI-Reference there is a difference between empty
      and absent paths, represented by [] and null, respectively.

   *  An empty outer array ([]) is not a valid CRI.  It is a valid CRI
      reference, equivalent to [0] as per Section 5.2, which essentially
      copies the base CRI up to and including the path section,
      unsetting query and fragment.

                       +-----------+---------------+
                       | Section   | Default Value |
                       +-----------+---------------+
                       | scheme    | –             |
                       | authority | null          |
                       | discard   | 0             |
                       | path      | []            |
                       | query     | null          |
                       | fragment  | null          |

                              for CRI Sections

   Application specifications that use CRIs may explicitly enable the
   use of "stand-in" items (tags or simple values).  These are data
   items used in place of original representation items such as strings
   or arrays, where the tag or simple value is defined to stand for a
   data item that can be used in the position of the stand-in item.
   Examples would be (1) tags such as 21 to 23 (Section 3.4.5.2 of RFC
   8949 [STD94]) or 108 (Section 2.1 of



Bormann & Birkholz      Expires 12 September 2025              [Page 14]

   [I-D.bormann-cbor-notable-tags]), which stand for text string
   components but internally employ more compact byte string
   representations, or (2) reference tags and simple values as defined
   in [I-D.ietf-cbor-packed].  Note that application specifications need
   to be explicit about which stand-in items are allowed; otherwise,
   inconsistent interpretations at different places in a system can lead
   to check/use vulnerabilities.

   For interchange as separate encoded data items, CRIs MUST NOT use
   indefinite length encoding (see Section 3.2 of RFC 8949 [STD94]).
   This requirement is relaxed for specifications that embed CRIs into
   an encompassing CBOR representation that does provide for indefinite
   length encoding; those specifications that are selective in where
   they provide for indefinite length encoding are RECOMMENDED to not
   provide it for embedded CRIs.

5.1.1.  scheme-name and scheme-id

   In the scheme section, a CRI scheme can be given as a negative
   integer scheme-id derived from the _scheme number_, or optionally by
   its scheme-name (a text string giving the scheme name as in URIs'
   scheme section, mapped to lower case).  (Note that, in Figure 2,
   scheme-name is marked as a feature, as only less constrained CRI
   implementations might support scheme-name.)

   Scheme numbers are unsigned integers that are mapped to and from URI
   scheme names by the "CRI Scheme Numbers" registry (Section 11.1).
   The relationship of a scheme number to its scheme-id is as follows:

   scheme-id = -1 - scheme-number
   scheme-number = -1 - scheme-id

   For example, the scheme-name coap has the (unsigned integer) scheme-
   number 0 which is represented in a (negative integer) scheme-id -1.

5.1.2.  The discard Section

   The discard section can be used in a CRI reference when neither a
   scheme nor an authority is present.  It then expresses the operations
   performed on a base CRI by CRI references that are equivalent to URI
   references with relative paths and path prefixes such as "/", "./",
   "../", "../../", etc.
   "." and ".." are not available in CRIs and are therefore expressed
   using discard after a normalization step, as is the presence or
   absence of a leading "/".

Internet-Draft      Constrained Resource Identifiers          March 2025


   E.g., a simple URI reference "foo" specifies to remove one trailing
   segment, if any, from the base URI's path, which is represented in
   the equivalent CRI reference discard section as the value 1;
   similarly "../foo" removes two trailing segments, if any, represented
   as 2; and "/foo" removes all segments, represented in the discard
   section as the value true.  The exact semantics of the section values
   are defined by Section 5.3.

   Most URI references that Section 4.2 of RFC 3986 [STD66] calls
   "relative references" (i.e., references that need to undergo a
   resolution process to obtain a URI) correspond to the CRI reference
   form that starts with discard.  The exception are relative references
   with an authority (called a "network-path reference" in Section 4.2
   of RFC 3986 [STD66]), which discard the entire path of the base CRI.
   These CRI references never carry a discard section: the value of
   discard defaults to true.

   ]

5.1.4.  Specific Terminology

   A CRI reference is considered _well-formed_ if it matches the
   structure as expressed in Figure 2 in CDDL, with the additional
   requirement that trailing null values are removed from the array.



Bormann & Birkholz      Expires 12 September 2025              [Page 16]

Internet-Draft      Constrained Resource Identifiers          March 2025


   A CRI reference is considered a _full_ CRI if it is well-formed and
   the sequence of sections starts with a non-null scheme.

   A CRI reference is considered _relative_ if it is well-formed and the
   sequence of sections is empty or starts with a section other than
   those that would constitute a scheme.

5.2.  Ingesting and encoding a CRI Reference

   From an abstract point of view, a CRI reference is a data structure
   with six sections:

   scheme, authority, discard, path, query, fragment

   We refer to this as the _abstract form_, while the _interchange form_
   (Figure 2) has either two sections for scheme and authority or one
   section for discard, but never both of these alternatives.

   Each of the sections in the abstract form can be unset ("null"),
   except for discard, which is always an unsigned integer or true.  If
   scheme and/or authority are non-null, discard is set to true.

   When ingesting a CRI reference that is in interchange form, those
   sections are filled in from interchange form (unset sections are
   filled with null), and the following steps are performed:

   *  If the array is empty, replace it with [0].

   *  If discard is present in interchange form (i.e., the outer array
      starts with true or an unsigned integer), set scheme and authority
      to null.

   *  If scheme and/or authority are present in interchange form (i.e.,
      the outer array starts with null, a text string, or a negative
      integer), set discard to true.

   Upon encoding the abstract form into interchange form, the inverse
   processing is performed: If scheme and/or authority are not null, the
   discard value is not transferred (it must be true in this case).  If
   they are both null, they are both left out and only discard is
   transferred.  Trailing null values are removed from the array.  As a
   special case, an empty array is sent in place for a remaining [0]
   (URI reference "").

5.2.1.  Error handling and extensibility

   It is recommended that specifications that describe the use of CRIs
   in CBOR-based protocols use the error handling mechanisms outlined in
   this section.  Implementations of this document MUST adhere to these
   rules unless a containing document overrides them.

   When encountering a CRI that is well-formed in terms of CBOR, but
   that

   *  is not well-formed as a CRI,

   *  does not meet the other requirements on CRIs that are not covered
      by the term "well-formed", or

   *  uses features not supported by the implementation,

   the CRI is treated as "unprocessable".

   When encountering an unprocessable CRI, the processor skips the
   entire CRI top-level array, including any CBOR items contained in
   there, and continues processing the CBOR items surrounding the
   unprocessable CRI.  (Note: this skipping can be implemented in
   bounded memory for CRIs that do not use indefinite length encoding,
   as mandated in Section 5.1.)

   The unprocessable CRI is treated as an opaque identifier that is
   distinct from all processable CRIs, and distinct from all
   unprocessable CRIs with different CBOR representations.  It is up to
   the implementation whether unprocessable CRIs with identical
   representations are treated as identical to each other or not.
   Unprocessable CRIs cannot be dereferenced, and it is an error to
   query any of their components.

   This mechanism ensures that CRI extensions (using originally defined
   features or later extensions) can be used without extending the
   compatibility hazard to the containing document.  For example, if a
   collection of possible interaction targets contains several CRIs,
   some of which use the "no-authority" feature, an application
   consuming that collection that does not support that feature can
   still offer the supported interaction targets.

   The duty of checking validity is with the recipients that rely on
   this validity.  An intermediary that does not use the detailed
   information in a CRI (or merely performs reference resolution) MAY
   pass on a CRI/CRI reference without having fully checked it, relying
   on the producer having generated a valid CRI/CRI reference.  This is
   true for both basic CRIs (e.g., checking for valid UTF-8) and for
   extensions (e.g., checking both for valid UTF-8 and the minimal use
   of PET elements in extended-cris as per Section 7.1).

   A system that is checking a CRI for some reason but is not its
   ultimate recipient needs to consider the tension between security
   requirements and the danger of ossification [RFC9170]: If the system
   rejects anything that it does not know, it prevents the other
   components from making use of extensions.  If it passes through
   extensions unknown to it, that might allow semantics pass through
   that the system should have been designed to filter out.

5.3.  Reference Resolution

   The term "relative" implies that a "base CRI" exists against which
   the relative reference is applied.  Aside from fragment-only
   references, relative references are only usable when a base CRI is
   known.

   The following steps define the process of resolving any well-formed
   CRI reference against a base CRI so that the result is a full CRI in
   the form of an CRI reference:

   1.  Establish the base CRI of the CRI reference (compare Section 5.1
       of RFC 3986 [STD66]) and express it in the form of an abstract
       (full) CRI reference.

   2.  Initialize a buffer with the sections from the base CRI.

   3.  If the value of discard is true in the CRI reference (which is
       implicitly the case when scheme and/or authority are present in
       the reference), replace the path in the buffer with the empty
       array, unset query and fragment, and set a true authority to
       null.  If the value of discard is an unsigned integer, remove as
       many elements from the end of the path array; if it is non-zero,
       unset query and fragment.

       Set discard to true in the buffer.

   4.  If the path section is set in the CRI reference, append all
       elements from the path array to the array in the path section in
       the buffer; unset query and fragment.

Internet-Draft      Constrained Resource Identifiers          March 2025


   5.  Apart from the path and discard, copy all non-null sections from
       the CRI reference to the buffer in sequence; unset query in the
       buffer if query is the empty array [] in the CRI reference; unset
       fragment in the buffer if query is non-null in the CRI reference.

   6.  Return the sections in the buffer as the resolved CRI.

6.  Relationship between CRIs, URIs, and IRIs

   CRIs are meant to replace both Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)
   [STD66] and Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) [RFC3987]
   in constrained environments [RFC7228][I-D.ietf-iotops-7228bis].
   Applications in these environments may never need to use URIs and
   IRIs directly, especially when the resource identifier is used simply
   for identification purposes or when the CRI can be directly converted
   into a CoAP request.

   However, it may be necessary in other environments to determine the
   associated URI or IRI of a CRI, and vice versa.  Applications can
   perform these conversions as follows:

   CRI to URI
      A CRI is converted to a URI as specified in Section 6.1.

   URI to CRI
      The method of converting a URI to a CRI is unspecified;
      implementations are free to use any algorithm as long as
      converting the resulting CRI back to a URI yields an equivalent
      URI.

      Note that CRIs are defined to enable implementing conversions from
      or to URIs analogously to processing URIs into CoAP Options and
      back, with the exception that item 8 of Section 6.4 of [RFC7252]
      and item 7 of Section 6.5 of [RFC7252] do not apply to CRI
      processing.  See SP1 in Appendix B for more details.

   CRI to IRI
      A CRI can be converted to an IRI by first converting it to a URI
      as specified in Section 6.1, and then converting the URI to an IRI
      as described in Section 3.2 of [RFC3987].

   IRI to CRI
      An IRI can be converted to a CRI by first converting it to a URI
      as described in Section 3.1 of [RFC3987], and then converting the
      URI to a CRI as described above.

   Everything in this section also applies to CRI references, URI
   references, and IRI references.

6.1.  Converting CRIs to URIs

   Applications MUST convert a CRI reference to a URI reference by
   determining the components of the URI reference according to the
   following steps and then recomposing the components to a URI
   reference string as specified in Section 5.3 of RFC 3986 [STD66].

   scheme
      If the CRI reference contains a scheme section, the scheme
      component of the URI reference consists of the value of that
      section, if text (scheme-name); or, if a negative integer is given
      (scheme-id), the lower case scheme name corresponding to the
      scheme-id as per Section 5.1.1.  Otherwise, the scheme component
      is unset.

   authority
      If the CRI reference contains a host-name or host-ip item, the
      authority component of the URI reference consists of a host
      subcomponent, optionally followed by a colon (":") character and a
      port subcomponent, optionally preceded by a userinfo subcomponent.
      Otherwise, the authority component is unset.

      The host subcomponent consists of the value of the host-name or
      host-ip item.

      The userinfo subcomponent, if present, is turned into a single
      string by appending a "@".  Otherwise, both the subcomponent and
      the "@" sign are omitted.  Any character in the value of the
      userinfo element that is not in the set of unreserved characters
      (Section 2.3 of RFC 3986 [STD66]) or "sub-delims" (Section 2.2 of
      RFC 3986 [STD66]) or a colon (":") MUST be percent-encoded.

      The host-name is turned into a single string by joining the
      elements separated by dots (".").  Any character in the elements
      of a host-name item that is not in the set of unreserved
      characters (Section 2.3 of RFC 3986 [STD66]) or "sub-delims"
      (Section 2.2 of RFC 3986 [STD66]) MUST be percent-encoded.  If
      there are dots (".") in such elements, the conversion fails
      (percent-encoding is not able to represent such elements, as
      normalization would turn the percent-encoding back to the
      unreserved character that a dot is.)

         |  Implementations with scheme-specific knowledge MAY convert
         |  individual elements by using the ToASCII procedure
         |  Section 4.1 of [RFC3490] as discussed in more detail in
         |  Section 3.1 of [RFC3987].  This should not be done if the
         |  next step of conversion is to an IRI as defined in Section 6
         |  (CRI to IRI).

      The value of a host-ip item MUST be represented as a string that
      matches the "IPv4address" or "IP-literal" rule (Section 3.2.2 of
      RFC 3986 [STD66]).

      Any zone-id is appended to the string; the details for how this is
      done are currently in flux in the URI specification: Section 2 of
      [RFC6874] uses percent-encoding and a separator of "%25", while
      proposals for a future superseding zone-id specification document
      (such as [I-D.carpenter-6man-rfc6874bis]) are being prepared; this
      also leads to a modified "IP-literal" rule as specified in these
      documents.  While the discussion about the representation of zone-
      id information in URIs is ongoing, CRIs maintain a position in the
      grammar for it (zone-id).  This can be used by consenting
      implementations to exchange zone information without being
      concerned by the ambiguity at the URI syntax level.  The
      assumption is that the present specification (1) either will be
      updated eventually to obtain consistent URI conversion of zone-id
      information (2) or there will be no representation of zone-id
      information in URIs.

      If the CRI reference contains a port item, the port subcomponent
      consists of the value of that item in decimal notation.
      Otherwise, the colon (":") character and the port subcomponent are
      both omitted.

   path
      If the CRI reference contains a discard item of value true, the
      path component is considered _rooted_.  If it contains a discard
      item of value 0 and the path item is present, the conversion
      fails.  If it contains a positive discard item, the path component
      is considered _unrooted_ and prefixed by as many "../" components
      as the discard value minus one indicates.  If the discard value is
      1 and the first element of the path contains a :, the path
      component is prefixed by "./" (this avoids the first element to
      appear as supplying a URI scheme; compare path-noscheme in
      Section 4.2 of RFC 3986 [STD66]).

      If the discard item is not present and the CRI reference contains
      an authority that is true, the path component of the URI reference
      is considered unrooted.  Otherwise, the path component is
      considered rooted.

Internet-Draft      Constrained Resource Identifiers          March 2025


      If the CRI reference contains one or more path items, the path
      component is constructed by concatenating the sequence of
      representations of these items.  These representations generally
      contain a leading slash ("/") character and the value of each
      item, processed as discussed below.  The leading slash character
      is omitted for the first path item only if the path component is
      considered "unrooted".

      Any character in the value of a path item that is not in the set
      of unreserved characters or "sub-delims" or a colon (":") or
      commercial at ("@") character MUST be percent-encoded.

      If the authority component is present (not null or true) and the
      path component does not match the "path-abempty" rule (Section 3.3
      of RFC 3986 [STD66]), the conversion fails.

      If the authority component is not present, but the scheme
      component is, and the path component does not match the "path-
      absolute", "path-rootless" (authority == true) or "path-empty"
      rule (Section 3.3 of RFC 3986 [STD66]), the conversion fails.

      If neither the authority component nor the scheme component are
      present, and the path component does not match the "path-
      absolute", "path-noscheme" or "path-empty" rule (Section 3.3 of
      RFC 3986 [STD66]), the conversion fails.

   query
      If the CRI reference contains one or more query items, the query
      component of the URI reference consists of the value of each item,
      separated by an ampersand ("&") character.  Otherwise, the query
      component is unset.

      Any character in the value of a query item that is not in the set
      of unreserved characters or "sub-delims" or a colon (":"),
      commercial at ("@"), slash ("/"), or question mark ("?") character
      MUST be percent-encoded.  Additionally, any ampersand character
      ("&") in the item value MUST be percent-encoded.

   fragment
      If the CRI reference contains a fragment item, the fragment
      component of the URI reference consists of the value of that item.
      Otherwise, the fragment component is unset.

      Any character in the value of a fragment item that is not in the
      set of unreserved characters or "sub-delims" or a colon (":"),
      commercial at ("@"), slash ("/"), or question mark ("?") character
      MUST be percent-encoded.

7.  Extending CRIs

   CRIs have been designed to relieve implementations operating on CRIs
   from string scanning, which both helps constrained implementations
   and implementations that need to achieve high throughput.

   The CRI structure described up to this point is termed the _Basic
   CRI_. It should be sufficient for all applications that use the CoAP
   protocol, as well as most other protocols employing URIs.

   However, Basic CRIs have one limitation: They do not support URI
   components that _require_ percent-encoding (Section 2.1 of RFC 3986
   [STD66]) to represent them in the URI syntax, except where that
   percent-encoding is used to escape the main delimiter in use.

   E.g., the URI

   https://alice/3%2f4-inch

   is represented by the basic CRI

   [-4, ["alice"], ["3/4-inch"]]

   However, percent-encoding that is used at the application level is
   not supported by basic CRIs:

   did:web:alice:7%3A1-balun

   Extended forms of CRIs may be defined to enable these applications.
   They will generally extend the potential values of text components of
   URIs, such as userinfo, hostnames, paths, queries, and fragments.

   One such extended form is described in the following Section 7.1.
   Consumers of CRIs will generally notice when an extended form is in
   use, by finding structures that do not match the CDDL rules given in
   Figure 2.  Future definitions of extended forms need to strive to be
   distinguishable in their structures from the extended form presented
   here as well as other future forms.

   Extensions to CRIs MUST NOT allow indefinite length items.  This
   provision ensures that recipients of CRIs can deal with unprocessable
   CRIs as described in Section 5.2.1.

7.1.  Extended CRI: Accommodating Percent Encoding (PET)

   This section presents a method to represent percent-encoded segments
   of userinfo, hostnames, paths, and queries, as well as fragments.

   The four CDDL rules

   userinfo    = (false, text .feature "userinfo")
   host-name   = (*text)
   path        = [*text]
   query       = [+text]
   fragment    = text

   are replaced with

   userinfo    = (false, text-or-pet .feature "userinfo")
   host-name   = (*text-or-pet)
   path        = [*text-or-pet]
   query       = [+text-or-pet]
   fragment    = text-or-pet

   text-or-pet = text /
       text-pet-sequence .feature "extended-cri"

   ; text1 and pet1 alternating, at least one pet1:
   text-pet-sequence = [?text1, ((+(pet1, text1), ?pet1) // pet1)]
   ; pet is percent-encoded bytes
   pet1 = bytes .ne ''
   text1 = text .ne ""

   That is, for each of the host-name, path, and query segments, and for
   the userinfo and fragment components, an alternate representation is
   provided besides a simple text string: a non-empty array of
   alternating non-blank text and byte strings, the text strings of
   which stand for non-percent-encoded text, while the byte strings
   retain the special semantics of percent-encoded text without actually
   being percent-encoded.

   The above DID URI can now be represented as:

   [-6, true, [["web:alice:7", ':', "1-balun"]]]

   (Note that, in CBOR diagnostic notation, single quotes delimit
   literals for byte strings, double quotes for text strings.)

   To yield a valid extended-cri, the use of byte strings MUST be
   minimal.  Both the following examples are therefore not valid:

   [-6, true, [["web:alice:", '7:', "1-balun"]]]

   [-6, true, [["web:alice:7", ':1', "-balun"]]]

   An algorithm for constructing a valid text-pet-sequence might
   repeatedly examine the byte sequences in each byte string; if such a
   sequence stands for an unreserved ASCII character, or constitutes a
   valid UTF-8 character ≥ U+0080, move this character over into a text
   string by appending it to the end of the preceding text string,
   prepending it to the start of the following text string, or splitting
   the byte string and inserting a new text string with this character,
   all while preserving the order of the bytes.  (Note that the
   properties of UTF-8 make this a simple linear process; working around
   the NFC constraint C0 in this way may be more complex.)

      |  Unlike the text elements of a path or a query, which through
      |  CoAP's heritage are designed to be processable element by
      |  element, a text-pet-sequence does not usually produce a
      |  semantically meaningful division into array elements.  This
      |  consequence of the flexibility in delimiters offered in URIs is
      |  demonstrated by this example, which structurally singles out
      |  the one ':' that is _not_ a delimiter at the application level.
      |  Applications designed for using CRIs will generally avoid using
      |  the extended-cri feature.  Applications using existing URI
      |  structures that require text-pet-sequence elements for their
      |  representation typically need to process them byte by byte.

8.  Integration into CoAP and ACE

   This section discusses ways in which CRIs can be used in the context
   of the CoAP protocol [RFC7252] and of Authorization for Constrained
   Environments (ACE), specifically the Authorization Information Format
   (AIF) [RFC9237].

8.1.  Converting Between CoAP CRIs and Sets of CoAP Options

   This section provides an analogue to Sections 6.4 and 6.5 of
   [RFC7252]: Computing a set of CoAP options from a request CRI
   (Section 8.1.1) and computing a request CRI from a set of COAP
   options (Section 8.1.2).

   This section makes use of the mapping between CRI scheme numbers and
   URI scheme names shown in Table 2:

8.1.1.  Decomposing a Request CRI into a set of CoAP Options

   The steps to parse a request's options from a CRI »cri« are as
   follows.  These steps either result in zero or more of the Uri-Host,
   Uri-Port, Uri-Path, and Uri-Query Options being included in the
   request or they fail.

   Where the following speaks of deriving a text-string for a CoAP
   Option value from a data item in the CRI, the presence of any text-
   pet-sequence subitem (Section 7.1) in this item fails this algorithm.

   1.  If »cri« is not a full CRI, then fail this algorithm.

   2.  Translate the scheme-id into a URI scheme name as per
       Section 5.1.1 and Table 2; if a scheme-id that corresponds to a
       scheme number not in this list is being used, or if a scheme-name
       is being used, fail this algorithm.  Remember the specific
       variant of CoAP to be used based on this URI scheme name.

   3.  If »cri« has a fragment component, then fail this algorithm.

   4.  If the host component of »cri« is a host-name, include a Uri-Host
       Option and let that option's value be the text string value of
       the host-name.

       If the host component of »cri« is a host-ip, check whether the IP
       address given represents the request's destination IP address
       (and, if present, zone-id).  Only if it does not, include a Uri-
       Host Option, and let that option's value be the text value of the
       URI representation of the IP address, as derived in Section 6.1,
       Paragraph 2.4.6.

Internet-Draft      Constrained Resource Identifiers          March 2025


   5.  If »cri« has a port component, then let »port« be that
       component's unsigned integer value; otherwise, let »port« be the
       default port number for the scheme.

   6.  If »port« does not equal the request's destination port, include
       a Uri-Port Option and let that option's value be »port«.

   7.  If the value of the path component of »cri« is empty or consists
       of a single empty string, then move to the next step.

       Otherwise, for each element in the »path« component, include a
       Uri-Path Option and let that option's value be the text string
       value of that element.

   8.  If »cri« has a query component, then, for each element in the
       query component, include a Uri-Query Option and let that option's
       value be the text string value of that element.

8.1.2.  Composing a Request CRI from a Set of CoAP Options

   The steps to construct a CRI from a request's options are as follows.
   These steps either result in a CRI or they fail.

   1.  Based on the variant of CoAP used in the request, choose a
       scheme-id as per Section 5.1.1 and table Table 2.  Use that as
       the first value in the resulting CRI array.

   2.  If the request includes a Uri-Host Option, insert an authority
       with its value determined as follows: If the value of the Uri-
       Host Option is a reg-name, include this as the host-name.  If the
       value is an IP-literal or IPv4address, extract any zone-id, and
       represent the IP address as a byte string of the correct length
       in host-ip, followed by any zone-id extracted if present.  If the
       value is none of the three, fail this algorithm.

       If the request does not include a Uri-Host Option, insert an
       authority with host-ip being the byte string that represents the
       request's destination IP address and, if one is present in the
       request's destination, add a zone-id.

   3.  If the request includes a Uri-Port Option, let »port« be that
       option's value.  Otherwise, let »port« be the request's
       destination port.  If »port« is not the default port for the
       scheme, then insert the integer value of »port« as the value of
       port in the authority.  Otherwise, elide the port.

   4.  Insert a path component that contains an array built from the
       text string values of the Uri-Path Options in the request, or an
       empty array if no such options are present.

   5.  Insert a query component that contains an array built from the
       text string values of the Uri-Query Options in the request, or an
       empty array if no such options are present.

8.2.  CoAP Options for Forward-Proxies

   Apart from the above procedures to convert CoAP CRIs to and from sets
   of CoAP Options, two additional CoAP Options are defined in
   Section 5.10.2 of [RFC7252] that support requests to forward-proxies:

   *  Proxy-Uri, and

   *  its more lightweight variant, Proxy-Scheme

   This section defines analogues of these that employ CRIs and the URI
   Scheme numbering provided by the present specification.

8.2.1.  Proxy-CRI

    +--------+---+---+---+---+-----------+--------+--------+---------+
    | No.    | C | U | N | R | Name      | Format | Length | Default |
    +--------+---+---+---+---+-----------+--------+--------+---------+
    | TBD235 | x | x | - |   | Proxy-Cri | opaque | 1-1023 | (none)  |
    +--------+---+---+---+---+-----------+--------+--------+---------+

                      Table 3: Proxy-Cri CoAP Option

   The Proxy-CRI Option carries an encoded CBOR data item that
   represents a full CRI.  It is used analogously to Proxy-Uri as
   defined in Section 5.10.2 of [RFC7252].  The Proxy-Cri Option MUST
   take precedence over any of the Uri-Host, Uri-Port, Uri-Path or Uri-
   Query options, as well as over any Proxy-Uri Option (each of which
   MUST NOT be included in a request containing the Proxy-Cri Option).

8.2.2.  Proxy-Scheme-Number

   +--------+-+-+-+-+---------------------+--------+--------+---------+
   | No.    |C|U|N|R| Name                | Format | Length | Default |

   The Proxy-Scheme-Number Option carries a CRI Scheme Number
   represented as a CoAP unsigned integer.  It is used analogously to
   Proxy-Scheme as defined in Section 5.10.2 of [RFC7252].

   The Proxy-Scheme Option MUST NOT be included in a request that also
   contains the Proxy-Scheme-Number Option; servers MUST reject the
   request if this is the case.

   As per Section 3.2 of [RFC7252], CoAP Options are only defined as one
   of empty, (text) string, opaque (byte string), or uint (unsigned
   integer).  The Option therefore carries an unsigned integer that
   represents the CRI scheme-number (which relates to a CRI scheme-id as
   defined in Section 5.1.1).  For instance, the scheme name "coap" has
   the scheme-number 0 and is represented as an unsigned integer by a
   zero-length CoAP Option value.

8.3.  ACE AIF

   The AIF (Authorization Information Format, [RFC9237]) defined by ACE
   by default uses the local part of a URI to identify a resource for
   which authorization is indicated.  The type and target of this
   information is an extension point, briefly called _Toid_ (Type of
   object identifier).  Section 11.5 registers "CRI-local-part" as a
   Toid.  Together with _Tperm_, an extension point for a way to
   indicate individual access rights (permissions), Section 2 of
   [RFC9237] defines its general Information Model as:

   AIF-Generic<Toid, Tperm> = [* [Toid, Tperm]]

   Using the definitions in Figure 2 together with the [RFC9237] default
   Tperm choice REST-method-set, this information model can be
   specialized as in:

   CRI-local-part = [path / null, ?query]
   AIF-CRI = AIF-Generic<CRI-local-part, REST-method-set>

9.  Implementation Status

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].

   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

   A golang implementation of revision -10 of this document is found at:
   https://github.com/thomas-fossati/href.  A Rust implementation is
   available at https://codeberg.org/chrysn/cri-ref; it is being updated
   to revision -18 at the time of writing.  A python implementation is
   available as part of https://gitlab.com/chrysn/micrurus but is based
   on revision -05.

10.  Security Considerations

   Parsers of CRI references must operate on input that is assumed to be
   untrusted.  This means that parsers MUST fail gracefully in the face
   of malicious inputs.  Additionally, parsers MUST be prepared to deal
   with resource exhaustion (e.g., resulting from the allocation of big
   data items) or exhaustion of the call stack (stack overflow).  See
   Section 10 of RFC 8949 [STD94] for additional security considerations
   relating to CBOR.

   The security considerations discussed in Section 7 of RFC 3986
   [STD66] and Section 8 of [RFC3987] for URIs and IRIs also apply to
   CRIs.  The security considerations discussed for URIs in Section 6 of
   [RFC9237] apply analogously to AIF-CRI Section 8.3.

11.  IANA Considerations

11.1.  CRI Scheme Numbers Registry

   This specification defines a new "CRI Scheme Numbers" registry in the
   "Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) Parameters" registry group
   [IANA.core-parameters], with the policy "Expert Review" (Section 4.5
   of RFC 8126 [BCP26]).  The objective is to have CRI scheme number
   values registered for all registered URI schemes (Uniform Resource
   Identifier (URI) Schemes registry), as well as exceptionally for
   certain text strings that the Designated Expert considers widely used
   in constrained applications in place of URI scheme names.

11.1.1.  Instructions for the Designated Expert

   The expert is instructed to be frugal in the allocation of CRI scheme
   number values whose scheme-id values (Section 5.1.1) have short
   representations (1+0 and 1+1 encoding), keeping them in reserve for
   applications that are likely to enjoy wide use and can make good use
   of their shortness.

   When the expert notices that a registration has been made in the
   Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) Schemes registry (see also
   Section 11.2), the expert is requested to initiate a parallel
   registration in the CRI Scheme Numbers registry.  CRI scheme number
   values in the range between 1000 and 20000 (inclusive) should be
   assigned unless a shorter representation in CRIs appears desirable.

   The expert exceptionally also may make such a registration for text
   strings that have not been registered in the Uniform Resource
   Identifier (URI) Schemes registry if and only if the expert considers
   them to be in wide use in place of URI scheme names in constrained
   applications.  (Note that registrations in the CRI Scheme Numbers
   registry are oblivious to the details of any URI Schemes registry
   registration, so if a registration is later made in the URI Schemes
   registry that uses such a previously unregistered text string as a
   name, the CRI Scheme Numbers registration simply stays in place, even
   if the URI Schemes registration happens to be for something different
   from what the expert had in mind at the time for the CRI Scheme
   Numbers registration.  Also note that the initial registrations in
   Appendix A already include such registrations for the text strings
   "mqtt" and "mqtts".)

   A registration in the CRI Scheme Numbers registry does not imply that
   a URI scheme under this name exists or has been registered in the
   Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) Schemes registry -- it essentially
   is only providing an integer identifier for an otherwise
   uninterpreted text string.

   Any questions or issues that might interest a wider audience might be
   raised by the expert on the core-parameters@ietf.org mailing list for
   a time-limited discussion.

11.1.2.  Structure of Entries

   Each entry in the registry must include:

   CRI scheme number:
      An unsigned integer unique in this registry

   URI scheme name:

Internet-Draft      Constrained Resource Identifiers          March 2025


      a text string that would be acceptable for registration as a URI
      Scheme Name in the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) Schemes
      registry

   Reference:
      a reference to a document, if available, or the registrant

   The Reference field can simply be a copy of the reference field for
   the URI-Scheme registration if that exists.  If not, it can contain
   helpful information (including the name of the registrant) that may
   be available for the registration, with the expectation that this
   will be updated if a URI-Scheme registration under that URI scheme
   name is later made.

11.1.3.  Initial Registrations

   The initial registrations for the CRI Scheme Numbers registry are
   provided in Appendix A.

11.2.  Update to "Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) Schemes" Registry

   RFC 7595 [BCP35] is updated to add the following note in the "Uniform
   Resource Identifier (URI) Schemes" Registry [IANA.uri-schemes]:

   |  The CRI Scheme Numbers Registry registers numeric identifiers for
   |  what essentially are URI Scheme names.  Registrants for the
   |  Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) Schemes Registry are requested
   |  to make a parallel registration in the CRI Scheme Numbers
   |  registry.  The number for this registration will be assigned by
   |  the Designated Expert for that registry.

11.3.  CBOR Diagnostic Notation Application-extension Identifiers
       Registry

   In the "Application-Extension Identifiers" registry in the "CBOR
   Diagnostic Notation" registry group [IANA.cbor-diagnostic-notation],
   IANA is requested to register the application-extension identifier
   cri as described in Table 5 and defined in Appendix C.

Appendix A.  Mapping Scheme Numbers to Scheme Names


   // RFC Ed.: throughout this section, please replace RFC-XXXX with the
   // RFC number of this specification and remove this note.

   Table 8 in Appendix A of [I-D.draft-ietf-core-href-18] lists the
   initial mapping from CRI scheme numbers to URI scheme names.  (This
   table was developed with a previous revision of the Internet-Draft of
   the RFC derived from this document but is not copied into the current
   draft or the actual RFC because it will be out-of-date quickly, and
   because the IANA registry should be the focal point for users of this
   registry, anyway.)

   The assignments from this table can be extracted from the XML form of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-core-href-18] (when stored in a file "this.xml") into
   CSV form [RFC4180] using this short Ruby program:

   require 'rexml/document'; include REXML
   XPath.each(Document.new(File.read("this.xml")),"/rfc/back//tr") {|r|
     puts XPath.each(r,"td").map{|d|d.text()}[0..1].join(",")}

Appendix B.  The Small Print

   This appendix lists a few corner cases of URI semantics that
   implementers of CRIs need to be aware of, but that are not
   representative of the normal operation of CRIs.

   SP1.  Initial (Lone/Leading) Empty Path Segments:

   *  _Lone empty path segments:_ As per [STD66], s://x is distinct from
      s://x/ -- i.e., a URI with an empty path ([] in CRI) is different
      from one with a lone empty path segment ([""]).  However, in HTTP
      and CoAP, they are implicitly aliased (for CoAP, in item 8 of
      Section 6.4 of [RFC7252]).  As per item 7 of Section 6.5 of
      [RFC7252], recomposition of a URI without Uri-Path Options from
      the other URI-related CoAP Options produces s://x/, not s://x --
      CoAP prefers the lone empty path segment form.  Similarly, after
      discussing HTTP semantics, Section 6.2.3 of RFC 3986 [STD66]
      states:

   |  In general, a URI that uses the generic syntax for authority with
   |  an empty path should be normalized to a path of "/".

   *  _Leading empty path segments without authority_: Somewhat related,
      note also that URIs and URI references that do not carry an
      authority cannot represent leading empty path segments (i.e., that
      are followed by further path segments): s://x//foo works, but in a
      s://foo URI or an (absolute-path) URI reference of the form //foo
      the double slash would be mis-parsed as leading in to an
      authority.

   SP2.  Constraints (Section 2) of CRIs/basic CRIs

         While most URIs in everyday use can be converted to CRIs and
         back to URIs matching the input after syntax-based
         normalization of the URI, these URIs illustrate the constraints
         by example:

         *  https://host%ffname, https://example.com/x?data=%ff

            All URI components must, after percent decoding, be valid
            UTF-8 encoded text.  Bytes that are not valid UTF-8 show up,
            for example, in BitTorrent web seeds.

            These URIs can be expressed when using the extended-cri
            feature.

         *  https://example.com/component%3bone;component%3btwo,
            http://example.com/component%3dequals

            While delimiters can be used in an escaped and unescaped
            form in URIs with generally distinct meanings, basic CRIs
            (i.e., without percent-encoded text Section 7.1) only
            support one escapable delimiter character per component,
            which is the delimiter by which the component is split up in
            the CRI.

            Note that the separators . (for authority parts), / (for
            paths), & (for query parameters) are special in that they
            are syntactic delimiters of their respective components in
            CRIs.  Thus, the following examples _are_ convertible to
            basic CRIs without the extended-cri feature:

            https://example.com/path%2fcomponent/second-component

            https://example.com/x?ampersand=%26&questionmark=?

         *  https://alice@example.com/

            The user information can be expressed in CRIs if the
            "userinfo" feature is present.  The URI https://@example.com
            is represented as [-4, [false, "", "example", "com"]]; the
            false serves as a marker that the next element is the
            userinfo.

            The rules explicitly cater for unencoded ":" in userinfo
            (without needing the extended-cri feature).  (We opted for
            including this syntactic feature instead of disabling it as
            a mechanism against potential uses of colons for the
            deprecated inclusion of unencrypted secrets.)

Appendix C.  CBOR Extended Diagnostic Notation (EDN): The "cri"
             Extension

   [I-D.ietf-cbor-edn-literals] more rigorously defines and further
   extends the CBOR Extended Diagnostic Notation (EDN), as originally
   introduced in Section 8 of RFC 8949 [STD94] and extended in
   Appendix G of [RFC8610].  Among others, it provides an extension
   point for "application-extension identifiers" that can be used to
   notate CBOR data items in application-specific ways.

   The present document defines and registers (Section 11.3) the
   application-extension identifier "cri", which can be used to notate
   an EDN literal for a CRI reference as defined in this document.

   The text of the literal is a URI Reference as per [STD66] or an IRI
   Reference as per [RFC3987].

   The value of the literal is a CRI reference that can be converted to
   the text of the literal using the procedure of Section 6.1.  Note
   that there may be more than one CRI reference that can be converted
   to the URI/IRI reference given; implementations are expected to favor
   the simplest variant available and make non-surprising choices
   otherwise.

   As an example, the CBOR diagnostic notation

   cri'https://example.com/bottarga/shaved'

   is equivalent to

   [-4, ["example", "com"], ["bottarga", "shaved"]]

   See Appendix C.1 for an ABNF definition for the content of cri
   literals.

C.1.  cri: ABNF Definition of URI Representation of a CRI

   The syntax of the content of cri literals can be described by the
   ABNF for URI-reference in Section 4.1 of RFC 3986 [STD66] with
   certain re-arrangements taken from Figure 5 of
   [I-D.ietf-cbor-edn-literals]; these are reproduced in Figure 6.  If
   the content is not ASCII only (i.e., for IRIs), first apply
   Section 3.1 of [RFC3987] and apply this grammar to the result.

   app-string-cri = URI-reference
   ; ABNF from RFC 3986:

   URI           = scheme ":" hier-part [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]

   hier-part     = "//" authority path-abempty

      from) CoAP Options; mention failure of percent-encoding for dots
      in host-name components

      Reference; generalize scheme numbers, add userinfo; add list of
      additional requirements in prose (Section 5.1, Paragraph 7)

   *  Discuss Error handling and extensibility (Section 5.2.1)

   *  Conversion to URI: Handle : in first pathname component of a CRI-
      Reference (Section 6.1, Paragraph 2.6.1)

   *  Add Christian Amsüss as contributor

   *  Add CBOR EDN application-extension "cri" (see Appendix C and

   Changes from -08 to -09

   *  Identify more esoteric features with a CDDL ".feature".

   *  URIs with an authority but a completely empty path (e.g.,
      http://example.com): CRIs with an authority component no longer
      always produce at least a slash in the path component.

      For generic schemes, the conversion of scheme://example.com to a
      CRI is now possible because CRI produces a URI with an authority
      not followed by a slash following the updated rules of
      Section 6.1.  Schemes like http and coap do not distinguish
      between the empty path and the path containing a single slash when
      an authority is set (as recommended in [STD66]).  For these
      schemes, that equivalence allows implementations to convert the
      just-a-slash URI to a CRI with a zero length path array (which,
      however, when converted back, does not produce a slash after the
      authority).

      (Add an appendix "the small print" for more detailed discussion of
      pesky corner cases like this.)

   Changes from -07 to -08

   *  Fix the encoding of NOAUTH-NOSLASH / NOAUTH-LEADINGSLASH

   *  Add URN and DID schemes, add example.

   *  Add PET

   *  Remove hopeless attempt to encode "remote trailing nulls" rule in
      CDDL (which is not a transformation language).

   Changes from -06 to -07

   *  More explicitly discuss constraints (Section 2), add examples
      (Appendix B, Paragraph 6, Item 1).

   *  Make CDDL more explicit about special simple values.

   *  Lots of gratuitous changes from XML2RFC redefinition of <tt>
      semantics.

   Changes from -05 to -06

   *  rework authority:

      -  split reg-names at dots;

      -  add optional zone identifiers [RFC6874] to IP addresses

   Changes from -04 to -05

   *  Simplify CBOR structure.

   completing this work with a view to achieve good integration with the
   potential use cases, both inside and outside of CoRAL.
