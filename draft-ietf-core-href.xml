      <t>
        Constrained Resource Identifiers (CoRIs) are an alternate
        serialization of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) that encodes the URI
        components in Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) instead of
        a string of characters. This simplifies parsing, reference resolution,
        and comparison of URIs in environments with severe limitations on
        processing power, code size, and memory size.

      <name>Introduction</name>

      <t>
        <xref target="RFC3986">Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) references</xref> are the standard way to
        link to resources in hypertext formats such as <xref
        target="W3C.REC-html52-20171214">HTML</xref> or the <xref
        target="RFC8288">HTTP "Link" header field</xref>. A URI reference is
        either a URI or a relative reference that must be resolved against a
        base URI.
      </t>

      <t>
        URI references are strings of characters chosen from
        the repertoire of US-ASCII characters. The
        individual components of a URI reference are delimited by a
        number of reserved characters, which necessitates the use of
        percent-encoding when these reserved characters are used in a
        non-delimiting function. One component can also contain
        special dot-segments that affect how the component
        is to be interpreted. The resolution of URI references involves
        parsing the character string into its components, combining those
        components with the components of a base URI, merging path components,
        removing dot-segments, and recomposing the result back into a character
        string.
      </t>

      <t>
        Overall, the proper processing of URIs is quite complicated. This can be a
        problem in particular in <xref target="RFC7228">constrained
        environments</xref>, where devices often have severe code size
        limitations. As a result, many implementations in these environments
        choose to support only an ad-hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden,
        non-interoperable subset of half of the URI standard.
      </t>

      <t>
        This document introduces Constrained Resource Identifier (CoRI) references, an alternate serialization of
        URI references that encodes the URI components in <xref
        target="RFC7049">Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)</xref>
        instead of a string of characters. Assuming an implementation of CBOR
        is already present on a device, typical operations on URI
        references such as parsing, reference resolution, and comparison can
        be implemented more easily than for character strings. A full
        implementation that covers all corner cases is intended to be implementable in a
        relatively small amount of code.
      </t>

      <t>
        As a result of the simplification, CoRI references are not
        capable of expressing all URI references permitted by the syntax of RFC
        3986. (Hence the "constrained" in "Constrained Resource Identifiers".) The
        supported subset includes all <xref target="RFC7252">Constrained
        Application Protocol (CoAP) URIs</xref>, most <xref target="RFC7230">
        Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) URIs</xref>, and many other URIs
        that function as resource locators.

      <name>Data Model</name>

      <t>
        The data model for CoRI references is very similar to the <xref
        target="RFC7252">serialization of the request URI in CoAP messages</xref>: The
        components of a URI reference are encoded as a sequence of
        <em>options</em>, where each path segment and query parameter
        becomes its own option. Every option consists of an <em>option
        number</em> identifying the type of option (scheme, host name, path
        segment, etc.) and an <em>option value</em>.
      </t>

      <section>

        <name>Options</name>

        <t>
          The following types of options are defined:
        </t>

        <dl newline="true">
          <dt>scheme</dt>
          <dd>
            <t>
              Specifies the URI scheme.
              The option value can be any Unicode string matching the "scheme"
              rule described in <xref target="RFC3986">Section 3.1 of RFC
              3986</xref>, excluding uppercase letters.
            </t>
          </dd>
          <dt>host.name</dt>
          <dd>
            <t>
              Specifies the host of the URI authority as a registered
              name.
              The option value can be any Unicode string matching the
              specifications of the URI scheme.
            </t>
          </dd>
          <dt>host.ip</dt>
          <dd>
            <t>
              Specifies the host of the URI authority as an IPv4
              address or an IPv6 address.
              The option value is a byte string with a length of either 4 or 16 bytes,
              respectively.
            </t>
          </dd>
          <dt>port</dt>
          <dd>
            <t>
              Specifies the port number of the URI authority.
              The option value is an integer in the range from 0 to 65535.
            </t>
          </dd>
          <dt>path.type</dt>
          <dd>
            <t>
              Specifies the type of the URI path for reference
              resolution.
              The option value is an integer in the range from 0 to 127,
              named as follows:
            </t>

          <dd>
            <t>
              Specifies one segment of the URI path.
              The option value can be any Unicode string with the exception of "." and "..".
              This option can occur more than once.

          A well-formed sequence of options is considered

          An absolute sequence of options is considered

        <t>
          The following Python 3.6 code illustrates how to construct CoAP options from
          an absolute sequence of options. For simplicity, the code does not
          omit CoAP options with their default value.

      <name>Security Considerations</name>

      <t>
        Parsers must operate on input that is
        assumed to be untrusted. This means that parsers <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> fail gracefully in
        the face of malicious inputs. Additionally, parsers <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be prepared to
        deal with resource exhaustion (e.g., resulting from the allocation of
        big data items) or exhaustion of the call stack (stack overflow). See
        Section 8 of <xref target="RFC7049">RFC 7049</xref> for security
        considerations relating to CBOR.

      <t>
        The security considerations discussed in <xref target="RFC3986">Section
        7 of RFC 3986</xref> also apply to Constrained Resource Identifiers.
