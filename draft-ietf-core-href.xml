      <t>
        The Constrained Resource Identifier (CRI) is a complement to the Uniform
        Resource Identifier (URI) that serializes the URI components in Concise
        Binary Object Representation (CBOR) instead of a sequence of characters.

        This simplifies parsing, comparison and reference resolution in
        environments with severe limitations on processing power, code size, and
        memory size.

      <name>Introduction</name>

      <t>
        The <xref target="RFC3986">Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)</xref> and
        its most common usage, the URI reference, are the Internet standard for
        linking to resources in hypertext formats such as <xref
        target="W3C.REC-html52-20171214">HTML</xref> or the <xref
        target="RFC8288">HTTP "Link" header field</xref>.
      </t>

      <t>
        A URI reference is a sequence of characters chosen from the repertoire
        of US-ASCII characters.

        The individual components of a URI reference are delimited by a number
        of reserved characters, which necessitates the use of a character escape
        mechanism called "percent-encoding" when these reserved characters are used
        in a non-delimiting function.

        The resolution of URI references involves parsing a character sequence
        into its components, combining those components with the components of a
        base URI, merging path components, removing dot-segments, and
        recomposing the result back into a character sequence.
      </t>

      <t>
        Overall, the proper handling of URI references is quite intricate.

        This can be a problem especially in <xref target="RFC7228">constrained
        environments</xref>, where nodes often have severe code size and memory
        size limitations.

        As a result, many implementations in such environments support only an
        ad-hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, non-interoperable subset of
        half of RFC 3986.
      </t>

      <t>
        This document defines the Constrained Resource Identifier (CRI) by
        constraining URIs to a simplified subset and serializing their
        components in <xref target="I-D.ietf-cbor-7049bis">Concise Binary Object
        Representation (CBOR)</xref> instead of a sequence of characters.

        This allows typical operations on URI references such as parsing,
        comparison and reference resolution (including all corner cases) to be
        implemented in a comparatively small amount of code.
      </t>

      <t>
        As a result of simplification, however, CRIs are not capable of
        expressing all URIs permitted by the generic syntax of RFC 3986 (hence
        the "constrained" in "Constrained Resource Identifier").

        The supported subset includes all URIs of the <xref
        target="RFC7252">Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)</xref>, most
        URIs of the <xref target="RFC7230">Hypertext Transfer Protocol
        (HTTP)</xref>, <xref target="RFC8141">Uniform Resource Names
        (URNs)</xref>, and other similar URIs.

        The exact constraints are defined in <xref target="constraints"/>.

      <name>Constraints</name>

      <t>
        A Constrained Resource Identifier consists of the same five components
        as a URI: scheme, authority, path, query, and fragment.

        The components are subject to the following constraints:
      </t>

      <ol type="C%d.">
        <li anchor="c-scheme">
          The scheme name can be any Unicode string (see Definition D80 in <xref
          target="Unicode"/>) that matches the syntax of a URI scheme (see <xref
          target="RFC3986" section="3.1"/>) and is lowercase (see Definition D139
          in <xref target="Unicode"/>).
        </li>
        <li anchor="c-authority">
          An authority is always a host identified by an IP address or
          registered name, along with optional port information. User
          information is not supported.
        </li>
        <li anchor="c-ip-address">
          An IP address can be either an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address. IPv6
          scoped addressing zone identifiers and future versions of IP are not
          supported.
        </li>
        <li anchor="c-reg-name">
          A registered name can be any Unicode string that is lowercase and in
          Unicode Normalization Form C (NFC) (see Definition D120 in <xref
          target="Unicode"/>).

          (The syntax may be further restricted by the scheme.)
        </li>
        <li anchor="c-port-range">
          A port is always an integer in the range from 0 to 65535. Empty ports
          or ports outside this range are not supported.
        </li>
        <li anchor="c-port-omitted">
          The port is omitted if and only if the port would be the same as the
          scheme's default port (provided the scheme is defining such a default
          port) or the scheme is not using ports.
        </li>
        <li anchor="c-path">
          A path consists of zero or more path segments. A path must not consist
          of a single zero-length path segment, which is considered equivalent
          to a path of zero path segments.
        </li>
        <li anchor="c-path-segment">
          A path segment can be any Unicode string that is in NFC, with the
          exception of the special "." and ".." complete path segments. It can
          be the zero-length string. No special constraints are placed on the
          first path segment.
        </li>
        <li anchor="c-query">
          A query always consists of one or more query parameters. A query
          parameter can be any Unicode string that is in NFC. It is often in the
          form of a "key=value" pair. When converting a CRI to a URI, query
          parameters are separated by an ampersand ("&amp;") character.

          (This matches the structure and encoding of the target URI in CoAP
          requests.)
        </li>
        <li anchor="c-fragment">
          A fragment identifier can be any Unicode string that is in NFC.
        </li>
        <li anchor="c-escaping">
          The syntax of registered names, path segments, query parameters, and
          fragment identifiers may be further restricted and sub-structured by
          the scheme. There is no support, however, for escaping sub-delimiters
          that are not intended to be used in a delimiting function.
        </li>
        <li anchor="c-mapping">
          When converting a CRI to a URI, any character that is outside the
          allowed character range or a delimiter in the URI syntax is
          percent-encoded. For CRIs, percent-encoding always uses the UTF-8 encoding form
          (see Definition D92 in <xref target="Unicode"/>) to convert the
          character to a sequence of octets (that is then converted to a
          sequence of %HH triplets).
        </li>
      </ol>

      <name>Creation and Normalization</name>

      <t>
        In general, resource identifiers are created on the initial creation of a
        resource with a certain resource identifier, or the initial exposition
        of a resource under a particular resource identifier.
      </t>

      <t>
        A Constrained Resource Identifier <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be created by
        the naming authority that governs the namespace of the resource
        identifier. For example, for the resources of an HTTP origin server,
        that server is responsible for creating the CRIs for those resources.
      </t>

      <t>
        The naming authority <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> ensure that any CRI created satisfies
        the constraints defined in <xref target="constraints"/>. The creation of
        a CRI fails if the CRI cannot be validated to satisfy all of the
        constraints.
      </t>

      <t>
        If a naming authority creates a CRI from user input, it <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> apply
        the following (and only the following) normalizations to get the CRI
        more likely to validate:

        map the scheme name to lowercase
        (<xref target="c-scheme" format="counter"/>);

        map the registered name to NFC
        (<xref target="c-reg-name" format="counter"/>);

        elide the port if it's the default port for the scheme
        (<xref target="c-port-omitted" format="counter"/>);

        elide a single zero-length path segment
        (<xref target="c-path" format="counter"/>);

        map path segments, query parameters and the fragment identifier to NFC
        (<xref target="c-path-segment" format="counter"/>,
        <xref target="c-query" format="counter"/>,
        <xref target="c-fragment" format="counter"/>).
      </t>

      <t>
        Once a CRI has been created, it can be used and transferred without
        further normalization. All operations that operate on a CRI
        <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> rely on the assumption that the CRI is
        appropriately pre-normalized.

        (This does not contradict the requirement that when CRIs are
        transferred, recipients must operate on as-good-as untrusted input and
        fail gracefully in the face of malicious inputs.)
      </t>

    <section>

      <name>Comparison</name>

      <t>
        One of the most common operations on CRIs is comparison: determining
        whether two CRIs are equivalent, without using the CRIs to access their
        respective resource(s).
      </t>

      <t>
        Determination of equivalence or difference of CRIs is based on simple
        component-wise comparison. If two CRIs are identical
        component-by-component (using code-point-by-code-point comparison for
        components that are Unicode strings) then it is safe to conclude that
        they are equivalent.
      </t>

      <t>
        This comparison mechanism is designed to minimize false negatives while
        strictly avoiding false positives.

        The constraints defined in <xref target="constraints"/> imply the most
        common forms of syntax- and scheme-based normalizations in URIs, but do
        not comprise protocol-based normalizations that require accessing the
        resources or detailed knowledge of the scheme's dereference algorithm.

        False negatives can be caused, for example, by CRIs that are not
        appropriately pre-normalized and by resource aliases.
      </t>

      <t>
        When CRIs are compared to select (or avoid) a network action, such as
        retrieval of a representation, fragment components (if any) should be
        excluded from the comparison.
      </t>

    <section>

      <name>CRI References</name>

      <t>
        The most common usage of a Constrained Resource Identifier is to embed
        it in resource representations, e.g., to express a hyperlink between the
        represented resource and the resource identified by the CRI.
      </t>

      <t>
        This section defines the serialization of CRIs in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-cbor-7049bis">Concise Binary Object Representation
        (CBOR)</xref>.

        To reduce representation size, CRIs are not serialized directly.
        Instead, CRIs are indirectly referenced through <em>CRI references</em>.
        These take advantage of hierarchical locality and provide a very compact
        encoding. The CBOR serialization of CRI references is specified in <xref
        target="cbor-serialization"/>.
      </t>

      <t>
        The only operation defined on a CRI reference is <em>reference
        resolution</em>: the act of transforming a CRI reference into a CRI.

        An application <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> implement this operation by applying
        the algorithm specified in <xref target="reference-resolution"/> (or any
        algorithm that is functionally equivalent to it).
      </t>

      <t>
        The method of transforming a CRI into a CRI reference is unspecified;
        implementations are free to use any algorithm as long as reference
        resolution of the resulting CRI reference yields the original CRI.

        Notably, a CRI reference is not required to satisfy all of the
        constraints of a CRI; the only requirement on a CRI reference is that
        reference resolution <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> yield the original CRI.
      </t>

      <t>
        When testing for equivalence or difference, applications <bcp14>SHOULD
        NOT</bcp14> directly compare CRI references; the references should be
        resolved to their respective CRI before comparison.
      </t>

      <section anchor="cbor-serialization">

        <name>CBOR Serialization</name>

        <t>
          A CRI reference is encoded as a CBOR array <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-cbor-7049bis"/> that contains a sequence of zero or
          more options. Each option consists of an option number followed by an
          option value, holding one component or sub-component of the CRI
          reference. To reduce size, both option numbers and option values are
          immediate elements of the CBOR array and appear in alternating order.
        </t>

        <t>
          Not all possible sequences of options denote a well-formed CRI
          reference. The structure can be described in the <xref
          target="RFC8610">Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL)</xref> as
          follows:
        </t>

        <ul empty="true">
          <li>
<sourcecode type="cddl" markers="false">
CRI-Reference = [
  (?scheme, ?((host.name // host.ip), ?port) // path.type),

  *query,
  ?fragment
]

scheme    = (0, text .regexp "[a-z][a-z0-9+.-]*")
host.name = (1, text)
host.ip   = (2, bytes .size 4 / bytes .size 16)
port      = (3, 0..65535)
path.type = (4, 0..127)
path      = (5, text)
query     = (6, text)
fragment  = (7, text)
</sourcecode>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <t>
          The options correspond to the (sub-)components of a CRI, as described
          in <xref target="constraints"/>, with the addition of the
          <tt>path.type</tt> option. The <tt>path.type</tt> option can be used
          to express path prefixes like "/", "./", "../", "../../", etc. The
          exact semantics of the option values are defined by <xref
          target="reference-resolution"/>. A sequence of options that is empty
          or starts with a <tt>path</tt> option is equivalent the same sequence
          prefixed by a <tt>path.type</tt> option with value 2.
        </t>

        <t>
          Examples:

        <t>
          A CRI reference is considered <em>well-formed</em> if the sequence

        <t>
          A CRI reference is considered <em>absolute</em> if it is well-formed

        <t>
          A CRI reference is considered <em>relative</em> if it is well-formed

        <t>
          The term "relative" implies that a "base CRI" exists against which the

      <name>Relationship between CRIs, URIs and IRIs</name>

      <t>
        CRIs are meant to replace both <xref target="RFC3986">Uniform Resource
        Identifiers (URIs)</xref> and <xref target="RFC3987">Internationalized
        Resource Identifiers (IRIs)</xref> in <xref target="RFC7228">constrained
        environments</xref>.

        Applications in these environments may never need to use URIs and IRIs
        directly, especially when the resource identifier is used simply for
        identification purposes or when the CRI can be directly converted into a
        CoAP request.
      </t>

      <t>
        However, it may be necessary in other environments to determine the
        associated URI or IRI of a CRI, and vice versa. Applications can perform
        these conversions as follows:
      </t>

      <dl newline="true">
        <dt>
          CRI to URI
        </dt>
        <dd>
          A CRI is converted to a URI as specified in <xref
          target="cri-to-uri"/>.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          URI to CRI
        </dt>
        <dd>
          The method of converting a URI to a CRI is unspecified;
          implementations are free to use any algorithm as long as converting
          the resulting CRI back to a URI yields an equivalent URI.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          CRI to IRI
        </dt>
        <dd>
          A CRI can be converted to an IRI by first converting it to a URI as
          specified in <xref target="cri-to-uri"/>, and then converting the URI
          to an IRI as described in <xref target="RFC3987" section="3.2"/>.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          IRI to CRI
        </dt>
        <dd>
          An IRI can be converted to a CRI by first converting it to a URI as
          described in <xref target="RFC3987" section="3.1"/>, and then
          converting the URI to a CRI as described above.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <t>
        Everything in this section also applies to CRI references, URI
        references and IRI references.
      </t>

        <t>
          Applications <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> convert a CRI reference to a URI
          reference by determining the components of the URI reference according
          to the following steps and then recomposing the components to a URI
          reference string as specified in <xref target="RFC3986"
          section="5.3"/>.

              Otherwise, the colon (":") character and the port subcomponent are

      <name>Security Considerations</name>

      <t>
        Parsers of CRI references must operate on input that is assumed to be
        untrusted. This means that parsers <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> fail gracefully
        in the face of malicious inputs.

        Additionally, parsers <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be prepared to deal with
        resource exhaustion (e.g., resulting from the allocation of big data
        items) or exhaustion of the call stack (stack overflow).

        See <xref target="I-D.ietf-cbor-7049bis" section="10"/> for additional
        security considerations relating to CBOR.
