The Constrained Resource Identifier (CRI) is a complement to the Uniform
Resource Identifier (URI) that serializes the URI components in Concise
Binary Object Representation (CBOR) instead of a sequence of characters.
This simplifies parsing, comparison and reference resolution in
environments with severe limitations on processing power, code size, and
memory size.

# Introduction

The [Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)](#RFC3986) and its most common
usage, the URI reference, are the Internet standard for linking to
resources in hypertext formats such as [HTML](#W3C.REC-html52-20171214)
or the [HTTP "Link" header field](#RFC8288).

A URI reference is a sequence of characters chosen from the repertoire
of US-ASCII characters.
The individual components of a URI reference are delimited by a number
of reserved characters, which necessitates the use of a character escape
mechanism called "percent-encoding" when these reserved characters are
used in a non-delimiting function.
The resolution of URI references involves parsing a character sequence
into its components, combining those components with the components of a
base URI, merging path components, removing dot-segments, and
recomposing the result back into a character sequence.

Overall, the proper handling of URI references is quite intricate.
This can be a problem especially in [constrained environments](#RFC7228),
where nodes often have severe code size and memory size limitations.
As a result, many implementations in such environments support only an
ad-hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, non-interoperable subset of
half of RFC 3986.

This document defines the *Constrained Resource Identifier (CRI)* by
constraining URIs to a simplified subset and serializing their
components in [Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)](#RFC8949)
instead of a sequence of characters.
This allows typical operations on URI references such as parsing,
comparison and reference resolution (including all corner cases) to be
implemented in a comparatively small amount of code.

As a result of simplification, however, CRIs are not capable of
expressing all URIs permitted by the generic syntax of RFC 3986 (hence
the "constrained" in "Constrained Resource Identifier").
The supported subset includes all URIs of the
[Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)](#RFC7252), most URIs of the
[Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)](#RFC7230),
[Uniform Resource Names (URNs)](#RFC8141), and other similar URIs.
The exact constraints are defined in {{constraints}}.

## Notational Conventions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

In this specification, the term "byte" is used in its now customary
sense as a synonym for "octet".

Terms defined in this document appear in *cursive* where they
are introduced (rendered in plain text as the new term surrounded by
underscores).



# Constraints {#constraints}

A Constrained Resource Identifier consists of the same five components
as a URI: scheme, authority, path, query, and fragment.
The components are subject to the following constraints:

{: type="C%d."}
1. {:#c-scheme} The scheme name can be any Unicode string (see
   Definition D80 in {{Unicode}}) that matches the syntax of a URI
   scheme (see {{Section 3.1 of RFC3986}}, which constrains schemes to
   ASCII) and is lowercase (see Definition D139 in {{Unicode}}).
   The scheme is always present.

2. {:#c-authority} An authority is always a host identified by an IP
   address or registered name, along with optional port information.
   User information is not supported.
   <!-- Authorities are optional! -->

   Alternatively, the authority can be absent; the two cases for this
   defined in {{Section 3.3 of RFC3986}} are modeled by two different
   values used in place of an absent authority:

   * the path can begin with a root ("/", as when the authority is
     present), or
   * the path can be rootless.

3. {:#c-ip-address} An IP address can be either an IPv4 address or an
   IPv6 address, optionally with a zone identifier {{-zone}}.
   Future versions of IP are not supported.

4. {:#c-reg-name} A registered name is a sequence of one or more
   *labels*, which, when joined with dots (".") in between them,
   result in a Unicode string that is lowercase and in Unicode
   Normalization Form C (NFC) (see Definition D120 in {{Unicode}}).
   (The syntax may be further restricted by the scheme.)

5. {:#c-port-range} A port is always an integer in the range from 0 to 65535.
   Ports outside this range, empty ports (port subcomponents with no
   digits, see {{Section 3.2.3 of RFC3986}}), or ports with redundant
   leading zeros, are not supported.

6. {:#c-port-omitted} The port is omitted if and only if the port would be the same as the
   scheme's default port (provided the scheme is defining such a default
   port) or the scheme is not using ports.
   <!-- Note that this is hard to do by a generic URI implementation
   that may not know the scheme's default port -->

7. {:#c-path} A path consists of zero or more path segments.
   A path must not consist of a single zero-length path segment, which
   is considered equivalent to a path of zero path segments.

8. {:#c-path-segment} A path segment can be any Unicode string that is
   in NFC, with the exception of the special "." and ".." complete path
   segments.
   It can be the zero-length string. No special constraints are placed
   on the first path segment.
   <!-- explain last sentence vs. previous item -->

9. {:#c-query} A query always consists of one or more query parameters.
   A query parameter can be any Unicode string that is in NFC.
   It is often in the form of a "key=value" pair.
   When converting a CRI to a URI, query parameters are separated by an
   ampersand ("&") character.
   (This matches the structure and encoding of the target URI in CoAP
   requests.)
   Queries are optional; there is a difference between an absent query
   and a single query parameter that is the empty string.

10. {:#c-fragment} A fragment identifier can be any Unicode string that
   is in NFC.
   Fragment identifiers are optional; there is a difference between an
   absent fragment identifier and a fragment identifier that is the
   empty string.

11. {:#c-escaping} The syntax of registered names, path segments, query
   parameters, and fragment identifiers may be further restricted and
   sub-structured by the scheme.
   There is no support, however, for escaping sub-delimiters
   that are not intended to be used in a delimiting function.

12. {:#c-mapping} When converting a CRI to a URI, any character that is
   outside the allowed character range or is a delimiter in the URI syntax
   is percent-encoded.
   For CRIs, percent-encoding always uses the UTF-8 encoding form (see
   Definition D92 in {{Unicode}}) to convert the character to a sequence
   of bytes (that is then converted to a sequence of %HH triplets).
   <!-- As per 3986 2.1, use uppercase hex. -->

## Constraints by example

While most URIs in everyday use can be converted to CRIs and back to URIs
matching the input after syntax-based normalization of the URI,
these URIs illustrate the constraints by example:

* `https://host%ffname`, `https://example.com/x?data=%ff`

  All URI components must, after percent decoding, be valid UTF-8 encoded text.
  Bytes that are not valid UTF-8 show up, for example, in BitTorrent web seeds.
  <!-- <https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0017.html>, not sure this warrants an informative reference -->

* `https://example.com/component%3bone;component%3btwo`, `http://example.com/component%3dequals`

  While delimiters can be used in an escaped and unescaped form in URIs with generally distinct meanings,
  CRIs only support one escapable delimiter character per component,
  which is the delimiter by which the component is split up in the CRI.

  Note that the separators `.` (for authority parts), `/` (for paths), `&` (for query parameters)
  are special in that they are syntactic delimiters of their respective components in CRIs.
  Thus, the following examples *are* convertible to CRIs:

  `https://interior%2edot/`

  `https://example.com/path%2fcomponent/second-component`

  `https://example.com/x?ampersand=%26&questionmark=?`

* `https://alice@example.com/`

  The user information can not be expressed in CRIs.

* URIs with an authority but a completely empty path (eg. `http://example.com`)

  CRIs with an authority component always produce at least a slash in the path component.

  For generic schemes, the conversion of `scheme://example.com` to a CRI is impossible
  because no CRI produces a URI with an authority not followed by a slash following the rules of {{cri-to-uri}}.
  Most schemes do not distinguish between the empty path and the path containing a single slash when an authority is set
  (as recommended in {{RFC3986}}).
  For these schemes, that equivalence allows converting even the slash-less URI to a CRI
  (which, when converted back, produces a slash after the authority).

## Constraints not expressed by the data model

There are syntactically valid CRIs and CRI references that can not be converted into a URI or URI reference, respectively.

For CRI references, this is acceptable -- they can be resolved still and result in a valid CRI that can be converted back.
(An example of this is `[0, ["p"]]` which appends a slash and the path segment "p" to its base).

(Full) CRIs that do not correspond to a valid URI are not valid on their own, and can not be used.
Normatively they are characterized by the {{cri-to-uri}} process producing a valid and syntax-normalized URI.
For easier understanding, they are listed here:

* CRIs (and CRI references) containing a path component "." or "..".

  These would be removed by the remove_dot_segments algorithm of {{RFC3986}},
  and thus never produce a normalized URI after resolution.

  (In CRI references, the `discard` value is used to afford segment removal,
  and with "." being an unreserved character, expressing them as "%2e" and "%2e%2e" is not even viable,
  let alone practical).

* CRIs without authority whose path starts with two or more empty segments.

  When converted to URIs, these would violate the requirement that in absence of an authority, a URI's path can not begin with two slash characters,
  and they would be indistinguishable from a URI with a shorter path and a present but empty authority component.

# Creation and Normalization

In general, resource identifiers are created on the initial creation of a
resource with a certain resource identifier, or the initial exposition
of a resource under a particular resource identifier.

A Constrained Resource Identifier SHOULD be created by
the naming authority that governs the namespace of the resource
identifier (see also {{RFC8820}}).
For example, for the resources of an HTTP origin server,
that server is responsible for creating the CRIs for those resources.

The naming authority MUST ensure that any CRI created
satisfies the constraints defined in {{constraints}}. The creation of a
CRI fails if the CRI cannot be validated to satisfy all of the
constraints.

If a naming authority creates a CRI from user input, it MAY apply
the following (and only the following) normalizations to get the CRI
more likely to validate:

* map the scheme name to lowercase ({{<c-scheme}});
* map the registered name to NFC ({{<c-reg-name}}) and split it on
  embedded dots;
* elide the port if it is the default port for the scheme
({{<c-port-omitted}});
* elide a single zero-length path segment ({{<c-path}});
* map path segments, query parameters and the fragment identifier to NFC
({{<c-path-segment}}, {{<c-query}}, {{<c-fragment}}).

Once a CRI has been created, it can be used and transferred without
further normalization.
All operations that operate on a CRI SHOULD rely on the
assumption that the CRI is appropriately pre-normalized.
(This does not contradict the requirement that when CRIs are
transferred, recipients must operate on as-good-as untrusted input and
fail gracefully in the face of malicious inputs.)


# Comparison

One of the most common operations on CRIs is comparison: determining
whether two CRIs are equivalent, without dereferencing the CRIs (using
them to access their respective resource(s)).

Determination of equivalence or difference of CRIs is based on simple
component-wise comparison. If two CRIs are identical
component-by-component (using code-point-by-code-point comparison for
components that are Unicode strings) then it is safe to conclude that
they are equivalent.

This comparison mechanism is designed to minimize false negatives while
strictly avoiding false positives.
The constraints defined in {{constraints}} imply the most
common forms of syntax- and scheme-based normalizations in URIs, but do
not comprise protocol-based normalizations that require accessing the
resources or detailed knowledge of the scheme's dereference algorithm.
False negatives can be caused, for example, by CRIs that are not
appropriately pre-normalized and by resource aliases.

When CRIs are compared to select (or avoid) a network action, such as
retrieval of a representation, fragment components (if any) should be
excluded from the comparison.


# CRI References

The most common usage of a Constrained Resource Identifier is to embed
it in resource representations, e.g., to express a hyperlink between the
represented resource and the resource identified by the CRI.

This section defines the serialization of CRIs in
[Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)](#RFC8949).
To reduce representation size, CRIs are not serialized directly.
Instead, CRIs are indirectly referenced through *CRI references*.
These take advantage of hierarchical locality and provide a very compact
encoding.
The CBOR serialization of CRI references is specified in
{{cbor-serialization}}.

The only operation defined on a CRI reference is *reference resolution*:
the act of transforming a CRI reference into a CRI.
<!-- , relative to a base URI -->
An application MUST implement this operation by applying
the algorithm specified in {{reference-resolution}} (or any algorithm
that is functionally equivalent to it).

The reverse operation of transforming a CRI into a CRI reference is
unspecified;
implementations are free to use any algorithm as long as reference
resolution of the resulting CRI reference yields the original CRI.
Notably, a CRI reference is not required to satisfy all of the
constraints of a CRI; the only requirement on a CRI reference is that
reference resolution MUST yield the original CRI.

When testing for equivalence or difference, applications SHOULD NOT
directly compare CRI references; the references should be
resolved to their respective CRI before comparison.

## CBOR Serialization {#cbor-serialization}

A CRI reference is encoded as a CBOR array {{RFC8949}}, with the
structure as described in the [Concise Data Definition Language
(CDDL)](#RFC8610) as follows:

~~~~ cddl
{::include cddl/cri.cddl}
~~~~

This CDDL specification is simplified for exposition and needs to be augmented by the
following rule for interchange: Trailing null values MUST be removed, and
two leading null values (scheme and authority both not given) are
represented by using the `discard` alternative instead.

The rules `scheme`, `authority`, `path`, `query`, `fragment`
correspond to the (sub-)components of a CRI, as described in
{{constraints}}, with the addition of the `discard` section.
The `discard` section can be used when neither a scheme nor an
authority is present.
It then expresses path
prefixes such as "/",
"./", "../", "../../", etc.
The exact semantics of the section values are defined by
{{reference-resolution}}.

Most URI references that {{Section 4.2 of RFC3986}} calls "relative
references" (i.e., references that need to undergo a resolution
process to obtain a URI) correspond to the CRI form that starts with
`discard`.  The exception are relative references with an `authority`
(called a "network-path reference" in {{Section 4.2 of RFC3986}}),
which in CRI references never carry a `discard` section (the value of
`discard` defaults to `true`).

A CRI reference is considered *well-formed* if it matches the CDDL
structure.

A CRI reference is considered *absolute* if it is well-formed
and the sequence of sections starts with a non-null `scheme`.

A CRI reference is considered *relative* if it is well-formed
and the sequence of sections is empty or starts with a section other
than those that would constitute a `scheme`.

## Ingesting and encoding a CRI Reference

From an abstract point of view, a CRI Reference is a data structure
with six sections:

scheme, authority, discard, path, query, fragment

Each of these sections can be unset ("null"),
<!-- "not defined" in RFC 3986 -->
except for discard,
which is always an unsigned number or `true`.  If scheme and/or
authority are non-null, discard must be `true`.

When ingesting a CRI Reference that is in the transfer form, those
sections are filled in from the transfer form (unset sections are
filled with null), and the following steps are performed:

* If the array is entirely empty, replace it with `[0]`.
* If discard is present in the transfer form (i.e., the outer array
  starts with true or an unsigned number), set scheme and authority to null.
* If scheme and/or authority are present in the transfer form (i.e.,
  the outer array starts with null, a text string, or a negative integer), set
  discard to `true`.

Upon encoding the abstract form into the transfer form, the inverse
processing is performed:  If scheme and/or authority are not null, the
discard value is not transferred (it must be true in this case).  If
they are both null, they are both left out and only discard is
transferred.
Trailing null values are removed from the array.
As a special case, an empty array is sent in place for a remaining
`[0]` (URI "").

## Reference Resolution {#reference-resolution}

The term "relative" implies that a "base CRI" exists against which the
relative reference is applied. Aside from fragment-only references,
relative references are only usable when a base CRI is known.

The following steps define the process of resolving any well-formed CRI
reference against a base CRI so that the result is a CRI in the form of
an absolute CRI reference:

1. Establish the base CRI of the CRI reference and express it in the
  form of an abstract absolute CRI reference.

2. Initialize a buffer with the sections from the base CRI.

3. If the value of discard is `true` in the CRI reference, replace the
   path in the buffer with the empty array, unset query and
   fragment, and set a `true` authority to `null`.  If the value of
   discard is an unsigned number, remove as many elements
   from the end of the path array; if it is non-zero, unset query and
   fragment.  Set discard to `true` in the buffer.

4. If the path section is set in the CRI reference, append all
   elements from the path array to the array in the path section in
   the buffer; unset query and fragment.

5. Apart from the path and discard, copy all non-null sections from
   the CRI reference to the buffer in sequence; unset fragment if
   query is non-null and thus copied.

6. Return the sections in the buffer as the resolved CRI.


# Relationship between CRIs, URIs and IRIs

CRIs are meant to replace both [Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)](#RFC3986)
and [Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs)](#RFC3987)
in [constrained environments](#RFC7228).
Applications in these environments may never need to use URIs and IRIs
directly, especially when the resource identifier is used simply for
identification purposes or when the CRI can be directly converted into a
CoAP request.

However, it may be necessary in other environments to determine the
associated URI or IRI of a CRI, and vice versa. Applications can perform
these conversions as follows:

{: vspace='0'}
CRI to URI
: A CRI is converted to a URI as specified in {{cri-to-uri}}.

URI to CRI
: The method of converting a URI to a CRI is unspecified;
  implementations are free to use any algorithm as long as converting
  the resulting CRI back to a URI yields an equivalent URI.

CRI to IRI
: A CRI can be converted to an IRI by first converting it to a URI as
  specified in {{cri-to-uri}}, and then converting the URI
  to an IRI as described in {{Section 3.2 of RFC3987}}.

IRI to CRI
: An IRI can be converted to a CRI by first converting it to a URI as
  described in {{Section 3.1 of RFC3987}}, and then
  converting the URI to a CRI as described above.

<!-- What? -->
Everything in this section also applies to CRI references, URI
references and IRI references.


## Converting CRIs to URIs {#cri-to-uri}

Applications MUST convert a CRI reference to a URI
reference by determining the components of the URI reference according
to the following steps and then recomposing the components to a URI
reference string as specified in {{Section 5.3 of RFC3986}}.

{: vspace='0'}

scheme
: If the CRI reference contains a `scheme` section, the scheme
  component of the URI reference consists of the value of that
  section.
  Otherwise, the scheme component is unset.

authority
: If the CRI reference contains a `host-name` or `host-ip` item, the
  authority component of the URI reference consists of a host
  subcomponent, optionally followed by a colon (":") character and a
  port subcomponent.  Otherwise, the authority component is unset.

  The host subcomponent consists of the value of the `host-name` or
  `host-ip` item.

  The `host-name` is turned into a single string by joining the
  elements separated by dots (".").
  Any character in the value of a `host-name` item that is not in
  the set of unreserved characters ({{Section 2.3 of RFC3986}}) or
  "sub-delims" ({{Section 2.2 of RFC3986}}) MUST be
  percent-encoded.

  The value of a `host-ip` item MUST be
  represented as a string that matches the "IPv4address" or
  "IP-literal" rule ({{Section 3.2.2 of RFC3986}}).
  Any zone-id is appended to the string, separated by "%25" as
  defined in {{Section 2 of -zone}}, or as specified in a successor
  zone-id specification document; this also leads to a modified
  "IP-literal" rule as specified in these documents.

  If the CRI reference contains a `port` item, the port
  subcomponent consists of the value of that item in decimal
  notation.
  Otherwise, the colon (":") character and the port subcomponent are
  both omitted.

path
: If the CRI reference contains a `discard` item of value `true`, the
  path component is prefixed by a slash ("/") character.  If it
  contains a `discard` item of value `0` and the `path` item is
  present, the conversion fails.  If it contains a positive discard
  item, the path component is
  prefixed by as many "../" components as the `discard` value minus
  one indicates.

  If the discard item is not present and the CRI reference contains an
  authority that is `true`, the path component of the URI reference is
  prefixed by the zero-length string.  Otherwise, the path component
  is prefixed by a slash ("/") character.

  If the CRI reference contains one or more `path` items, the prefix
  is followed by the value of each item, separated by a slash ("/")
  character.  <!-- A path segment that contains a colon character (e.g., -->
  <!-- "this:that") cannot directly be used as the first such item.  Such a -->
  <!-- segment MUST be preceded by a dot-segment (e.g., "./this:that") -->
  <!-- unless scheme and/or authority are present. -->

  Any character in the value of a `path` item that is not
  in the set of unreserved characters or "sub-delims" or a colon
  (":") or commercial at ("@") character MUST be
  percent-encoded.

  If the authority component is present (not `null` or `true`) and the
  path component does not match the "path-abempty" rule ({{Section 3.3
  of RFC3986}}), the conversion fails.

  If the authority component is not present, but the scheme component
  is, and the path component does not match the "path-absolute",
  "path-rootless" (authority == `true`) or "path-empty" rule ({{Section
  3.3 of RFC3986}}), the conversion fails.

  If neither the authority component nor the scheme component are
  present, and the path component does not match the "path-absolute",
  "path-noscheme" or "path-empty" rule ({{Section 3.3 of RFC3986}}), the
  conversion fails.

query
: If the CRI reference contains one or more `query` items,
  the query component of the URI reference consists of the value of
  each item, separated by an ampersand ("&") character.
  Otherwise, the query component is unset.

  Any character in the value of a `query` item that is not
  in the set of unreserved characters or "sub-delims" or a colon
  (":"), commercial at ("@"), slash ("/") or question mark ("?")
  character MUST be percent-encoded.
  Additionally, any ampersand character ("&") in the item
  value MUST be percent-encoded.

fragment
: If the CRI reference contains a fragment item, the fragment
  component of the URI reference consists of the value of that
  item.
  Otherwise, the fragment component is unset.

  Any character in the value of a `fragment` item that is
  not in the set of unreserved characters or "sub-delims" or a colon
  (":"), commercial at ("@"), slash ("/") or question mark ("?")
  character MUST be percent-encoded.

# Extended CRI: Accommodating Percent Encoding

CRIs have been designed to relieve implementations operating on CRIs
from string scanning, which both helps constrained implementations and
implementations that need to achieve high throughput.

Basic CRI does not support URI components that *require*
percent-encoding ({{Section 2.1 of -uri}}) to represent them in the URI
syntax, except where that percent-encoding is used to escape the main
delimiter in use.

E.g., the URI

~~~ uri
https://alice/3%2f4-inch
~~~

is represented by the basic CRI

~~~ coap-diag
[-4, ["alice"], ["3/4-inch"]]
~~~

However, percent-encoding that is used at the application level is not
supported by basic CRIs:

~~~ uri
did:web:alice:7%3A1-balun
~~~

This section presents a method to represent percent-encoded segments
of hostnames, paths, and queries.

The three CDDL rules

~~~ cddl
host-name   = (*text)
path        = [*text]
query       = [*text]
~~~

are replaced with

~~~ cddl
host-name   = (*text-or-pet)
path        = [*text-or-pet]
query       = [*text-or-pet]

text-or-pet = text /
    ([*(text, pet), ?text]) .feature "extended-cri"

; pet is perent-encoded bytes
pet = bytes .ne ''
~~~

That is, for each of the host-name, path, and query segments, for each
segment an alternate representation is provided: an array of text
strings, the even-numbered ones of which are normal text strings,
while the odd-numbered ones are text strings that retain the special
semantics of percent-encoded text without actually being
percent-encoded.

The above DID URI can now be represented as:

~~~ cri
[-6, true, [["web:alice:7", ":", "1-balun"]]]
~~~

# Implementation Status {#impl}

With the exception of the authority=true fix and host-names split into
labels, CRIs are implemented in `https://gitlab.com/chrysn/micrurus`.
<!-- see RFC 7942 -->

# Security Considerations {#security}

Parsers of CRI references must operate on input that is assumed to be
untrusted. This means that parsers MUST fail gracefully
in the face of malicious inputs.
Additionally, parsers MUST be prepared to deal with
resource exhaustion (e.g., resulting from the allocation of big data
items) or exhaustion of the call stack (stack overflow).
See {{Section 10 of RFC8949}} for additional
security considerations relating to CBOR.

The security considerations discussed in {{Section 7 of RFC3986}} and
{{Section 8 of RFC3987}} for URIs and IRIs also apply to CRIs.

CRIs were developed by {{{Klaus Hartke}}} for use in the Constrained
RESTful Application Language (CoRAL).
The current author team is completing this work with a view to achieve
good integration with the potential use cases, both inside and outside of CoRAL.
