# HREF Test Vectors

The file [tests.json](tests.json) contains a set of test vectors for [draft-ietf-core-href-07](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-core-href-07.html) derived from [Carsten's initial proposal](https://notes.ietf.org/2Y2YyFstQ5uenofIGBa4IQ).

> NOTE: some tests are currently broken, see annotations in the [master copy](https://notes.ietf.org/2Y2YyFstQ5uenofIGBa4IQ).

## Test Input

### Bases

All test vectors use the same base URI `coaps://foo:4711/pa/th?query#frag`, which corresponds to the base CRI `[-2, ["foo", 4711], ["pa", "th"], ["query"], "frag"]`.

### Test Vector Layout

Each test vector is organized as follows:

| Key Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `uri` | a URI reference |
| `cri` | hex-encoded CBOR representation of the CRI reference corresponding to `uri` |
| `uri-from-cri` | the URI obtained translating the CRI reference `cri` |
| `resolved-cri` | hex-encoded CBOR representation of the resolved CRI reference relative to the [base CRI](#bases) |
| `resolved-uri` | resolved URI relative to the [base URI](#bases) |

### Test Vector CSV Layout

The test vectors are assembled in a CSV (RFC 4180)
comma-separated-value file.

Since `"` and `,` are very frequent, we instead use these settings:

```ruby
CSV.generate(col_sep: ";", quote_char: "|", quote_empty: false)
```

(Note that, with these settings, no quote character is used at all for
the extant examples.)

The columns are:

| Key Name           | Description                                                                             |
| ---                | ---                                                                                     |
| `type`             | kind of test[^2]                                                                        |
| `uri`              | a URI reference                                                                         |
| `cri`              | EDN CBOR representation of the CRI reference corresponding to `uri`                     |
| `red`              | `uri` reference after normalization if type=red, empty otherwise                        |
| `resolved-cri`     | EDN CBOR representation of the resolved CRI reference relative to the [base CRI](#bases) |
| `cri_hex`          | `cri` in CBOR hexdump format                                                            |
| `resolved_cri_hex` | `resolved_cri` in CBOR hexdump format                                                   |
| `description`      | comment                                                                                 |
| `features_needed`  | comma-separted list of features that are needed, possibly including extra feature names[^1] |

[^2]: Test types are:
    * `base`: Establishes a base URI for the resolution of URI references (first line)
    * `rt`: A CRI reference that can be expresed as a URI reference, and it round-trips.
    * `red`: Like red, but the `uri` reference given is not the one produced by the CRI-to-URI algorithm.
    * `only-cri-ref`: A CRI reference that can not be expressed as a URI reference. Its `cri` is empty.

[^1]: Three feature names currently help implementations select tests which they can not expect to pass:
    * "broken": The test just looks somewhat right, and implementations that don't enforce CRI correctness would probably come to the test vector's conclusions, but something is wrong about the test. The description usually describes what that is.
    * "zone-id-6874": The test only works if the URI processor uses RFC6874 zone identifiers (`[fe80::%25eth0]`).
    * "zone-id-6874bis": The test only works if the URI processor uses draft-carpenter-6man-rfc6874bis-03 zone identifiers (`[fe80::%eth0]`).

An initial line with type `base` gives the base URI and CRI applied, see above.

## Test Logics

### CBOR deserialization

* Parse `cri` according to [ยง5.1](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-core-href-07.html#section-5.1) and assert there are no errors

### Converting CRIs to URIs

* Convert `cri` to URI according to [ยง6.1](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-core-href-07.html#section-6.1) and assert the result matches `uri-from-cri`
* Convert `resolved-cri` to URI and assert the result matches `resolved-uri`

### Reference Resolution

* Resolve `cri` relative to the [base CRI](#bases) according to [ยง5.3](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-core-href-07.html#section-5.3) and assert the result matches `resolved-cri`
