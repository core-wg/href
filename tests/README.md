# HREF Test Vectors

The file [tests.json](tests.json) contains a set of test vectors for [draft-ietf-core-href-07](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-core-href-07.html) derived from [Carsten's initial proposal](https://notes.ietf.org/2Y2YyFstQ5uenofIGBa4IQ).

> NOTE: some tests are currently broken, see annotations in the [master copy](https://notes.ietf.org/2Y2YyFstQ5uenofIGBa4IQ).

## Test Input

### Bases

All test vectors use the same base URI `coaps://foo:4711/pa/th?query#frag`, which corresponds to the base CRI `[-2, ["foo", 4711], ["pa", "th"], ["query"], "frag"]`.

### Test Vector Layout

Each test vector is organized as follows:

| Key Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `uri` | a URI reference |
| `cri` | hex-encoded CBOR representation of the CRI reference corresponding to `uri` |
| `uri-from-cri` | the URI obtained translating the CRI reference `cri` |
| `resolved-cri` | hex-encoded CBOR representation of the resolved CRI reference relative to the [base CRI](#bases) |
| `resolved-uri` | resolved URI relative to the [base URI](#bases) |

### Test Vector CSV Layout

The test vectors are assembled in a CSV (RFC 4180)
comma-separated-value file.

Since `"` and `,` are very frequent, we instead use these settings:

```ruby
CSV.generate(col_sep: ";", quote_char: "|", quote_empty: false)
```

(Note that, with these settings, no quote character is used at all for
the extant examples.)

The columns are:

| Key Name           | Description                                                                             |
| ---                | ---                                                                                     |
| `type`             | kind of test: `ok`, `rt` (round-trip), `red` (normalized on roundtrip); special value `base` |
| `uri`              | a URI reference                                                                         |
| `cri`              | EDN CBOR representation of the CRI reference corresponding to `uri`                     |
| `red`              | `uri` reference after normalization if type=red, empty otherwise                        |
| `resolved-cri`     | EDN CBOR representation of the resolved CRI reference relative to the [base CRI](#bases) |
| `cri_hex`          | `cri` in CBOR hexdump format                                                            |
| `resolved_cri_hex` | `resolved_cri` in CBOR hexdump format                                                   |
| `description`      | comment                                                                                 |
| `features_needed`  | comma-separted list of features that are needed, possibly including "broken"[^1]        |

[^1]: Tests with the feature "broken" look somewhat right, and implementations that don't reject them outright would probably come to the test vector's conclusions, but something is wrong about them. The description usually describes what that is.

An initial line with type `base` gives the base URI and CRI applied, see above.

Use the command

    bundle

to install the dependencies.

## Test Logics

### CBOR deserialization

* Parse `cri` according to [§5.1](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-core-href-07.html#section-5.1) and assert there are no errors

### Converting CRIs to URIs

* Convert `cri` to URI according to [§6.1](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-core-href-07.html#section-6.1) and assert the result matches `uri-from-cri`
* Convert `resolved-cri` to URI and assert the result matches `resolved-uri`

### Reference Resolution

* Resolve `cri` relative to the [base CRI](#bases) according to [§5.3](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-core-href-07.html#section-5.3) and assert the result matches `resolved-cri`
